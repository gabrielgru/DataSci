"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2017-02-06","I'll give the food a solid 4 stars. It is very good. My issue is with the shady business practices.  I ordered enchiladas. The menu stated 3 of them. When I received my order there were 2. I triple checked the item I ordered and I was correct. The menu item clearly stated 3. As I am not one to quickly write a bad review, I contacted the restaurant via the yelp app. No response. I went to attempt to order the same item and a banner popped up saying the description of the item had changed since I last ordered it. The new description not stating a quantity.  So management saw my inquiry, ignored me and changed the menu item without offering any compensation. That is some shady business.    You just lost a customer over one enchilada. Adios Muchachos!","Michael T."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2017-03-07","Good food and great drinks. The Diablo wings live up to the name, and the Mole dishes are excellent. Taco Tuesdays are great way to try different styles tacos for cheap.","Mike P."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2016-04-30","They have good food and really good prices for groups.  If you planning to celebrate your special day with big family that would be good choice. I was here with my family members celebrated special day.  Waitress service was good. Guacamole with chips was included all other menu specials.","Nick M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2016-05-12","Food is so delicious and authentic , best place in queens to eat Mexican food  Good food, music, drinks and company.  This Sunnyside gem is located right on Queens blvd and has alot to offer. Thanks to SRW (Sunnyside Restaurant Week) for exposing me to this part of town.","Noel P."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2017-01-06","Was offered a complimentary drink or dessert to a group of people for not making it to happy hour on time, bill was quite large and though a small gesture will not kill or make us or the business, the guy ran off and did not deliver.  What a pity.","Ever V."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2015-12-24","I was hesitant to go in.  The restaurant is dark.  Looks like a club from the outside.  But my husband wanted Mexican food, so we gave it a go, without reading reviews. My first experience with coconut frozen margaritas.  Woowee!  Delish and strong, plus you get a couple of dollars off during happy hour.   Our meals were great.  I had shrimp ajillo: nice sized shrimp in a delicious garlic sauce served with beans, rice and salad.  (Nothing was left on my plate.)  T, always on the quest for good chili rellenos, ordered it here.  He liked it better than our usual place in Georgia.  Even the salsa was an upgrade from what we get at home: chunky, flavorful.  Yum.","Meredith R."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2016-04-01","I really can't tell you guys how much in love I am with this place! After my initial first visit (check previous review) I really have made this my go to spot for Mexican cuisine. Also found out about TACO TUESDAY! $2 tacos! You can mix and match any tacos for $2 each! So if you're feeling steak and chorizo taco you can get that, or you can get a couple of  specialty tacos like the Baja fish tacos (love!) for less than $9!  Staff, SUPER friendly and nice especially the new manager, Payton, very attentive and hilarious! Made us feel like we were at home. Kept checking up on us from time to time to make sure we were well taken care of. Definitely guys, come and try this place. Ambiance, food, music, and staff are just amazing!","Stephanie W."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2015-10-27","Good food, music, drinks and company. What more could you ask for?  This Sunnyside gem is located right on Queens blvd and has alot to offer. Thanks to SRW (Sunnyside Restaurant Week) for exposing me to this part of town. We dined in on a Friday night about 10 pm and the place was packed. They had the music pumping playing lots of Top 40, reggaeton and old school joints. The environment was live and everyone was definitely having a good time. After a few drinks the DJ had us dancing in our seats lol Since its around Halloween time, they had the entire restaurant decorated festively; ghouls hanging from the ceiling, blood splattered walls, spider webs etc. It was pretty cool and you could tell they put a hell of alot of work into decorating the entire restaurant. The SRW prefix menu we were offered was a great deal. There were atleast 5 appetizer and entree options for us to choose from, two for dessert and two complimentary drinks (sangria/margarita) for only $28 pp! The portions were large and we all were pleased with the food. The calamari, chicken soup and quesadillas were perfection. My shrimp with garlic sauce was great, rice and beans good, the churros and flan for dessert were classically amazing. My fellow diners mentioned the crab in their shrimp and crab enchiladas was non existent but overall they were delicious.  The margaritas were strong (my friend could only finish one of hers lol) and the constant flow of sangrias had me feeling good. Our waitress made sure that we never had an empty glass, which was awesome. She was a bit slow though with picking up dirty plates and bringing out our food. We didn't mind as the drinks and convos kept us occupied. Overall she was very friendly and made wonderful suggestions to us.  Their regular menu looks extensive and I can't wait to come back and try other things.","Dyanne S."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2015-11-18","I've been going to Arriba for two years now.  The main draw is the music and ambiance; if you go there often enough you'll know sasha, jennifer, Cristina, et al.   I would suggest the California burrito for food, and for drinks something that's of menu: The Viviana!  Ask sasha for a Viviana and you'll love it.","Dennis G."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2015-09-30","My friends and I come here for one reason..strong frozen margaritas!  The location isn't bad since it's right off the train so if you've had more than one of those margaritas, you'll be safe getting home. The food isn't bad as well. A little pricey for the portion that you get but the quality is great. You can tell it wasn't pre made or microwaved. They have plated dishes as well as tacos, quesadillas, and nachos for those who want to drink and have something to pick at. It wasn't on their menu but I got an Al Pastor quesadilla. The presentation was above average and it was just the right amount. It comes with a side of guacamole as well. The meat could have been seasoned more but it didn't take away from the quesadilla itself. It was topped with queso fresco so it has a nice touch to it.  The service was good as well. Even though there were only a few tables seated, they made sure to refill out waters and check up on us. And like all young people do, they didn't mind splitting the bill with cash and 2 credit cards which would annoy any waiter or waitress. I would come back with a group of friends but I probably won't be going solo.","Kevin L."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2016-03-06","I don't know.. I have mixed feelings about this place. The customers are very nice and friendly. Some guy offered to buy me a drink although I've never met him in my life. Another beautiful Spanish lady offered to teach me salsa and led me to the dance floor. Very warm ambiance indeed.  My only take on the place is that I found it to be quite expensive given it's in the backwards of Queens Blvd. a simple cocktail could run you at about $15 PLUS tax and gratuity, 30% more expensive than similar adjacent restaurants in the Sunnyside area. Yes the place is too dark as other reviewers have mentioned and the decoration is humble. My table was wobbling all night I had to stabilize it with one hand while holding my drink with the other. Nice vibe overall, particularly on Saturdays, but it doesn't come out cheap.","Modo Z."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2016-09-09","Let me start by expressing my frustrations in having to actually give this place a 1 star rating as it will not allow me to give an honest review of No stars.  I recently moved to the area and was seeking some Spanish food. Arriba Arriba was recommended to me by a coworker and I decided to give it a try. Not only did I have a terrible experience but I felt bad for the employees working in this location. While ordering I felt somewhat uncomfortable as I was being stared down by what would seem to be an owner or manager. While reviewing the menu I noticed that the prices seemed high but thought I would give it a try regardless. I placed my order and when my food finally arrived it was less than impressive.  It tasted like reheated takeout and I immediately regretted my decision. I probably would have been better off eating at the taco truck across the street. While sitting there frustrated with my decision, I witnessed the same gentleman who was awkwardly eyeing me earlier yelling at one of the servers. This seemed highly unprofessional as it was done in front of customers trying to enjoy there less than satisfactory food and decent conversations with friends or family.  This made me feel so uncomfortable that at one point I contemplated interrupting the dispute to ask for my check. This saddened me as I had previously heard such great things about taco Tuesday in regards to the staff and ambiance. Just to clarify this visit was not on a Tuesday and so I can not remark on what that may have been like. All I can assume is that there are clear inconsistencies.  I will not be returning nor recommending. The only recommendation I have is; Do not waste your time or hard earned $$ in this establishment unless you are seeking mediocre food at Manhattan prices and a less than professional environment.","Jenn H."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2016-04-27","I have been on tuesday night and really love the tacos. Staff super friendly and attentive too I will be back","Valerio M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2016-01-23","The meals are delicious.  They come in huge portions!  The clincher is that they accept reservations and large groups!  It has a great vibe with decorations and a theme.   I like the music and the food.  I find that lighting in the restaurant is not bright.  Hence, my food coma kicking in right after the meal. The waitresses are really nice and patient.  The drinks are about ten bucks.  The meals are a bit on the expensive side, but not crazier than Manhattan prices.  They are worth it, since each dish is really equivalent to that of two meals.","Polly H."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2016-07-17","Nice Mexican place in Sunnyside.  They have a decent menu but it's very noisy inside.","Tom T."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2014-09-20","This place is pretty darn great for tacos and mohitos.  They also offer live dj and gets pretty loud. Food is great, for what it's worth. The staff is great and friendly, so I like this place.","Michael L."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2016-01-27","I leave in the neighborhood great place. Yelp try it out.omg the fish tacos are amazing got to try them new on the menu.","Carlos M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2016-06-23","Out of all the Mexican restaurants in sunnyside, this is probably one of the best ones. I have been here numerous times and have always been satisfied. The food is delicious and tasty. They have a wide variety of dishes! Just a warning about the wings: they are very spicy even if you say not that spicy.The drinks are also very good.Especially, the jalapeño margaritas! I'm giving this place four stars because of the service.Sometimes the waiters can be a bit rude or can take too long to serve you.Overall, this food has great food,drinks,and music depending on the day.","Pao C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2016-01-26","I've been here twice, the first time i walked in the place had maybe three customers in the entire establishment... Score!.... I'm not a fan of bumping elbows with someone I don't know. The food was O.k. i had the steak tacos and i ordered a margarita and a mojito. The drinks were good, the male bartender obviously knew how to make a mojito. On my second visit, the place was packed, which is fine. It's just the service was lacking, it took the waitress sometime to get back to my table and I asked her for water three times before I finally got it. The drinks this time around tasted like watered down bug spray. Ugh i dont know, it tasted like someone took a can of raid and sprayed every glass and bottle behind the bar,then proceeded to make my drink. It was either that or the measured ingredients were off. It was drinkable though, apart from the buggy after taste. ;o","Shenaid S."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2016-05-30","When you go to a good place, you always  come back to it.. when you are honest on how customers  service is or the food you will always  leave an honest review. Nothing  more, nothing  less.. great food, great, customer  service. Sat at the bar and Kathy  was on point.. Been coming here for over 10 yrs, that says  it all.. since Sasha was a busser, lol","Love2eat 7."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2015-11-27","Bartender Sasha and jennifer are the best ! This place will not be the same without them. Gerardo the manager is rude! Arriba Arriba will not be the awesome place without these bartenders!! Good job guys' we love u in woodside queens!! Management sucks!! They terrible !!","Sandy R."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2015-09-10","Can I give them zero stars? Went in for happy hour, first watery mix margarita is free, second one is $20!! What sort of happy hour is that?? Lousy drinks and a total ripoff.   Steer clear!!","Rob K."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2015-12-16","I came here for lunch because of their lunch specials.  The place was empty and the staff looked at me like I was from outer space when I came in.  The energy was weird!  They did not smile and it felt like I was had walked into a place where I was clearly not welcome.  I decided to stay, giving them the benefit of the doubt, because I had seen the place packed in the evenings.   I have seen it hopping like a club even!  When I finally tried it out...the place kind of seemed to have an identity crisis.  Is it a sports bar?  Is it a Mexican restaurant?  Or is it a club?  It really just looked trashy and beat inside.  The food was just ok.  The service was awkward.  I am definitely crossing this place off my list for eats.  Maybe it is just for drinks?","Jourdan D."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2016-04-07","I Absolutely love this place. I have been coming here for years and everything that I have had is awesome. It is one of my go to places for dinner with my friends or having it for our Friday lunches. They have great deals too. They have a pre-fixed dinner menu that is like $20 bucks, you can't beat that. I mean a drink, appetizer, entree and dessert. The portions are huge. I usually take home food every time i come here. The people are awesome especially Ivette. I love her! She is the best. Arriba arriba you have won my heart and my tummy!!!!!!!!","Nicola M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2016-03-05","Last time I was at the restaurant to eat was about a year ago and it wasn't that good at all. I recently gave it another try a couple nights ago and the quesadillas were AMAZING! I will definitely go back for the food to try another dish since the people next to me said the fish dish was delicious!","Katrina K."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2015-05-29","This place is a not worth your money. I ordered a mojito and some quesadillas. The mojito was water down and it tasted like lemonade (it had way too much sugar). Plus the mint was rotten.","Jhanet M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2016-02-22","The food was sub par.. The waiter took forever, and the manager didn't care that we had a horrible time getting food that wasn't on the menu.. I ordered something that wasn't given to me.. I'm mad.","ItsAddy B."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2016-09-06","Taco Tuesday is definitely the day to visit this place ..delicious tacos, fresh made guacamole. I normally come other days but Tuesday the service and environment is just warm and friendly. The manager and owner are so friendly and professional.","Lizbeth G."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2014-01-25","Blechhh. I have been here a few times with coworkers for Friday lunch. I'm a newer member of the department, so I usually just go along blindly where they tell me we're going. Honestly, I'd never actively choose to go here. I have tried a few things here, and nothing is really that good. Just typical Mexican-ish fast food. You get a free watered down cocktail with lunch, but I usually stick to Diet Coke since it's the middle of a work day. A few Fridays ago, we had a negative experience. When we asked to split the checks up 6 ways, which we've done several times, the waitress was whiny and complained. We were the only table in the place, we had done it before no problem, and we were semi-regulars at that point. Be cool. She finally relented, and as she was walking away, one coworker complained sarcastically (but not quietly enough), 'there goes her tip.' That one snide comment was enough for them to elect to tack on mandatory, unadvertised, one-time, 30% gratuity. Now I understand 18% gratuity for large parties, as long as it's on the menu upfront. This makes sense, especially for a busy booming restaurant. But we had NEVER been charged mandatory large party gratuity before, we weren't told about it upfront, and the place was empty. So nice job, you got your $2 out of me that day (that you would have gotten anyway), but you lost a set of large party regular customers.","Meghan A."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2015-06-21","Our waitress was very attentive, female bartender a bust. Like a simple margarita she couldn't make. And shrugs each time we sent back. Mgr was awesome!","Dat S."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2014-05-20","I like garlic shrimp! But, it's not something I typically order when dining out. I've been met, time and time again, with lackluster versions of a simple, albeit difficult to perfect dish. Too much garlic, not enough garlic, burnt butter, miniscule or overcooked shrimp: there always seemed to be something off about my meal when I order this popular special. Arriba Arriba executed it perfectly. Every aspect of my meal, from taste to plating was wonderful. I've also been able to sample their elote (AMAZING!), nachos, shrimp fajitas and enchiladas and a variety of their margaritas. I've yet to be disappointed! Service itself is a little shaky. Wait staff is very kind and courteous, but a little bit scatterbrained at times. Overall, not a big deal and certainly not enough to keep me away from their tasty food and strong drinks.","Camille M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2015-09-16","I LOVE the food here!! I had the grilled chicken or steak that comes with rice & beans, pico de gallo & guacamole DELISHH!. My man usually gets their burritos which are super delicious as well! .. Is give it a 5 star rating but the only reason it looses 2 stars is cause the service is kind of slow. Food takes a long time. And the first time we went there my man asked for a fresh lemonade which they made for him. The next 2 times we went they said they 'don't make fresh lemonade' which makes absolutely no sense ! Don't lie to your customers!","Danelly R."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2015-09-27","Sunday Brunch birthday party was a great hit. We had a group of 18 people and  I usually worry when we have so many people but the attention was incredible. Our waiters were on point! We had 18 people in our group. The food, service, space, drinks, etc was amazing. Our group was a big fan of the amount of food given and tasty drinks.  I stopped by here a couple of weeks ago for a farewell get together and was impressed how it was on a friday night. The DJ had people dancing up a storm and the ambiance was fun Everyone had a great time and we will definitely return","Gina C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2015-08-15","Terrible service. Someone in our party ordered fish tacos. Fish ceviche arrived. The waitress insisted it was our mistake, not hers, and proceeded to launch into the most combative, confrontational exchange we had ever seen in a restaurant.","Angus R."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2015-08-16","our waitress was top notch. veronika was the sweetest most attentive server ive met. she made sure we had all our condiments, water and drinks refilled and didnt rush us out. food came out fast, hot, and delicious. sizzling steak fajitas were great and so were the tacos al pastor. chips n dip included. nice place to ppl watch altho the music that night didnt go with the theme. its more of a sports bar with mexican food and busty waitresses. no complaints. oh wait... needs a bigger drink selection. also, pass on the caipirinhas.","Ms G."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2013-11-03","My first experience turned into my last experience here. Once I ordered a vegetarian omelet, I found a PUBIC hair in my food. I voiced my concerns to the waitress. She told the managers and they gave us a 15% discount. They should have comped me for the meal.  The waiters looked confused and didn't know what to do about the issue.  Disgusting.  Who does that???     I question their sanitary standards.","Jada C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2015-01-29","I was pretty damn surprised with this place. My dad and I came on a Tuesday night so the place was empty. And I was impressed by the freshness and quality of the food! Service was pretty good all around and we were very satisfied with the meal. I rate it a 4 star because while it was empty they had the music blaring extremely loud and we were the only ones there. It made it a bit annoying and uncomfortable to talk and eat. I get that this place is a bit of a dive bar, but when its empty and no ones around, I think they can afford to be milder with the volume especially at 5:30 pm.","S. P."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2015-08-17","Pros:  Reasonably fast delivery Portions are very generous Cons: Where do I start?  The food was gross. We ordered some steak nachos. They were awful. It was a giant, mushy pile of soggy crap. Barely any steak, and way too many beans, making it soggy as hell. They put some sort of shredded greens on top that were mushy and awful. We also ordered some tacos. These were not as bad as the nachos, but there was so much cilantro that it was overpowering, it was all you could taste. We should have had plenty of leftovers but the food was so bad that we just threw the leftovers away. Maybe it's better if you go there to eat instead of ordering delivery, maybe it's fresher and it probably tastes better if you have had a few margaritas already. Very pricy for the quality of food.","Kelly B."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2015-11-19","My favorite Sunnyside spot.  Sasha is my favorite bartender, he has a great personality.  His specialty are the Viviana's; order one and you'll love it.","Viviana C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2015-08-17","I was here over the weekend with a group of friends for dinner. The waitress brought out the food and had mixed up my friend's order for a different entree. He pointed out that she had served something he didn't order, but instead of apologizing and bringing out the correct item, she yelled at him (and then the whole table when we defended him), showed us where on her order pad she wrote down the wrong order, and dramatically screamed she would have to pay for his entree out of her own pocket if he didn't eat what she brought him. Really terrible customer service. Too bad I won't be going back, as the location is convenient and close to home.","Alex K."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2015-08-14","I came here for lunch during work. I went for the lunch special which included selected entrees to be included and drinks, either sangria, margarita or a soda. Once you sit down, they bring you nachos and salsa. When it came down to ordering, I got the quesadilla and the mango margarita. They charged extra for the mango flavoring but the drink was super strong. The waiter was flirting with me the whole time which was a little uncomfortable since I was just starving. The food took forever to come which was upsetting but when the quesadilla came, it was very small. It was more of a appetizer size. It wasn't all that but they're getting 3 stars for their strong drinks.","Jailene C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2014-11-10","I was hesitant to come here with some of the recent bad reviews but I wanted to make the decision for myself. My husband and I came here on a Saturday night around 6pm and besides a couple at the bar, we were the only ones in the restaurant. That always makes me a bit nervous. Our waitress was friendly and we were brought chips and salsa. We ordered a margarita each ($10 each) and an order of guacamole to start ($10). The guacamole was cold, which made me question if it was freshly made or if the avocados had just be in the fridge. It wasn't the best guac ever, but it was good. I also thought the portion size was appropriate for what we paid. The drinks were brought over in quite large glasses but they were very, very weak. I question whether or not there was any alcohol in them to be honest. For $10, this was a big disappointment.  I ordered the three tacos and my husband ordered a carnitas platter. The taco presentation was unique and the tacos looked like they were filled very well, not skimpy. The chorizo is some of the best I have ever had. The grilled chicken was average and the carnitas was pretty good.  We were given a re-fill on our chips, which is a perk I feel a lot of mexican restaurants are doing away with these days. I thought the service was great, but our bill came to $66 with tip, which is a lot for a restaurant in Queens that serves very weak drinks. We will probably be back eventually but we won't be ordering margaritas there.","Katie L."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2015-08-15","Had the tacos with ground beef, guacamole, and the taco salad with steak. All were delicious. Ordered the white sangria which we loved! The waitress was really attentive and personable. Sat at the tall table by the street which was really enjoyable as it was beautiful weather. Really recommend this restaurant!","Laura E."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2015-08-30","Lovely restaurant. Came here with my fiancé and the food was great. I had the three tacos with steak & it was just sooooo good especially with the rice and beans. The drink we had was the frozen margarita and it refreshing. Like the layout, the staff were friendly. Definitely recommend to anyone.","Vanessa C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2014-07-24","RIPOFF! !! Heard about the 'insane' happy hour, thought I'd check it out. Had a pre-mix margarita, didn't  taste any alcohol, asked for a second, same as the first. So I get my check for $20 (plus tax) and I asked about happy hour and was told yes, the first drink is free, but the second one is $20 !!! What sort of happy hour is that? Two watery drinks for $20!! Never going back, and neither should you!!","Rob K."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2016-03-24","LOVED this place, the food was so good, the service was great and fun. the vibe was great as well, everyone was interacting with eachother. the main thing that drawed me in was the music.","Natalie N."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2014-04-29","What happened to this place? Did management change? I've happily been coming here for years, but recently ate here for weekday lunch & a month later on a Saturday night & service was AWFUL. Lunch was very slow, but I thought it was just a fluke. Nope that's just how this place is operating now. Food for 4 without apps or special drink orders took 1 1/2 hours for the dinner. On top of that it came out cold! No one apologized for the wait or for it being cold and they did not offer to rectify the situation, as if they are just mindless drones taking orders. Will be looking for a new go-to Mexican place from now on.","Robin H."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2014-10-25","I liked the food a lot! The elote is great I usually get delivery from them, so I always ask for the elote and tortilla soup which I recomend 100% , however I decided to eat in today, the service wasn't very attentive and it took way too long to get our food. I guess I'll just keep getting deliveries from them.","Romy H."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2014-06-23","Last week during that really hot day, my coworkers luckily got out of work early and I had a craving for margaritas! My coworker who lives close by this place recommended that we go. After that 1/2 hour walk in the heat down queens blvd, we got here and it was soo HOT inside. They closed the door and turned the A.C. on and we ordered some frozen mango margaritas! $6 each and one free with our entree from the lunch specials menu. The drinks were GREAT. Nice and strong and it actually tasted like mango. I ordered a burrito and it was pretty good. Everyone else enjoyed their food. I had about 3 drinks. Those things sneak up on you. During the time we were here we got to see some of a soccer game. They also had some 'world cup' themed drinks, didnt try any though. For those looking for a decent spot in Sunnyside/LIC to watch the games i would take a trip here Our waiter could've been a bit more attentive, but I would go back.","Allysa P."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2015-08-14","So came here for happy hr  with my friend and the lady say do u want nachos and we say yes because we be came here a thousand times the minute u come in they give u free nachos. So then she comes with this order of guac and nachos that we have to pay for when we didn't order that. So be careful but other than that the drinks are awesome frozen margaritas for $6 happy hr til 7!","Jessica D."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2015-04-26","Friendly and quick customer service.  Waitresses were super sweet and accommodating. Food came out quickly and chips & salsa were served while waiting. Happy Hour is everyday 4 to 7. I got chicken quesadia.","Kinga S."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2014-06-18","Great atmosphere and good for groups. The waitstaff is very helpful and they have ridiculous happy hour specials (both for food and for drink). Entree portions are quiet large, but their appetizer portions are a bit disappointing.","Gordon C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2015-06-03","I first cam here with my mom and was surprised how delicious all the food was, we had a pitcher of Sangria which was also fabulous. It is hands down a new fav in queens, the have a wide variety of dishes and drinks.","Jacqueline H."

In case you're not sure what a bulldog margarita is, let me explain:  a very large frozen margarita with sangria, two shots and an upside down corona.  It's $23 a pop, but you will only need one!!  If you're not up for a bulldog you can get a scaled down version of it which is also a generous amount of frozen margarita, sangria and an upside down corona for $18.  And if you just want to go easy and get a regular margarita they're $5 a pop during happy hour!  They offer a wide array of Mexican dishes that are all delicious and generous in size! Our table ordered mussels, tacos, burritos and ceviche and there was not one complaint, actually all plates were wiped clean!!  The will also serve you some chips and salsa after being seated.  We ordered two bulldog margaritas, two scaled down bulldogs and a regular margarita, plus all the food, for four people and the check came out to $150.  NOT BAD!   The staff is very attentive, there is music (but no dancing at the time we went) and tv's behind the bar.  I would definitely have rated this place 5 stars if the environment were a bit more up beat.  It was pretty dead for it being after 6pm.  Maybe other evenings are a bit more lively but it definitely was not when we went.  However, I will most definitely return!","Jessie L."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2013-12-21","Never order for delivery!! This rest is awful for deliveries. You'll wait more then an hour even you're close to live to the rest. Plus the waiters/waitresses are rude enough and don't say even sorry. So I am totally done with this restaurant.","Merve K."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2013-03-24","I been here many times and have been meaning to review them. I love this place it's very cozy and intimate. I love their chicken tortilla soup it tastes like someone's grandmother made it, I always order the chicken enchiladas verdes which are really really good. As far as drinks I love their coconut margaritas. They have good Happy Hour specials and Monday-Wednesday (all day) they have a great special $15 which includes an appetizer, entree and 1 drink Just know that you have to ask about specials since they won't tell you so read the sign outside before coming in,","Isabel J."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2014-03-13","Mexican restaurant in the heart of Sunnyside.  Great happy hour menu so don't forget to take a look.  For about $14 you get an appetizer, an entrée & a drink. Portions are a good size. Everything is good. I love the tortilla soup, wings, lomo saltado, nachos & coconut margarita. Everything is seasoned very well. I love coming here. Very romantic place if you are on a date.","Tania C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2014-02-15","This place is very nice. The food was authentic Mexican, i loved it. Although the drinks are a bit pricey, the food is very good. The nachos & tacos are delicious here. Good food + good ambience = happy customer","Daniela G."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2014-05-28","Not the best Mexican food you'll find but it's pretty decent. I wish the place was slightly bigger and maybe a little brighter. I'm not a fan of eating in the dark but I guess it's suppose to be a date night kind of place. Their salsa is pretty good as well as their drinks.   Can't go wrong with the prices.","Sarah H."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2013-11-16","I am done coming here!  I love their food but that's it! I will order for take out. ...The chef is great but the establishment has these hidden charges that no one explains until the bill comes....they charge extra if you want flavors added to the margarita specials....what?? The waitress offered the flavors from the specials menu and at the end of the night says 'let me explain...The flavors are an additional 2-3 dollars more each drink'  I am done with ordering from here.","Diana F."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2015-02-14","Great place to go after work for drinks and good food! The enchiladas were some of the best i have had in queens. Their drinks are also pretty strong and pretty big.","Nitasha S."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2014-07-06","STAY AWAY ! MANAGEMENT IS RUDE AND NASTY, UNAPOLOGETIC AND WILL NOT CARE TO EMBARRASS CUSTOMERS .... Sadly , because I was starting to become a fan of the place .    This Friday was my second time at Arriba Arriba (the first time was incident free as this man who is either a manager or the owner was not present ) and I was hoping to enjoy watching the Brazil Versus Colombia World cup game with my mother, brother and a few friends.    We arrived a little early , and the game started at 4 p.m. , but right away we ordered margaritas, sangria , and shortly after started off with the Guacamole appetizer for the table. I had told two of my friends to meet me there , so we were waiting for them to order more food , but we kept ordering drinks in the meantime. The place started getting a little more crowded as several people were coming in to watch the game. The busboy had just come by to pick up our empty glasses and clear the table , and my brother had just put in an order for Tacos , and we were waiting on two more margaritas when ....       All of a sudden this man who I imagine is the manager or owner looks at our table and seemingly jumping to conclusions without first getting his facts straight , proceeds to come to the table and very rudely tell us that he needs the table because there are people coming in and that since we are not consuming we have to leave ! I could barely believe my ears , I have never been so appalled at the way this man handled himself towards customers. There are so many things wrong with this , where do I begin ?  First , if he really thought that we were not consuming because he glanced and saw the table was empty (while we awaited more food and drinks) , the logical thing would have been to find our server and check with her first , as she would have been able to inform him that we had been ordering drinks, guac, and had just put in a food order. Instead , he seemed to have jumped to conclusions and was very nasty in his delivery. I calmly explained to him that we had been consuming since we got there , and that additionally we were waiting for two more people and we had every intention of ordering full means as soon as they arrived . He continued to be rude and repeat himself that we needed to consume or had to leave because he needed the table. He then went over to find our server after the fact , and she explained to him that what I had told him was in fact accurate .    The game had just started when this happened and so on top of being rude and nasty , this man was now also interfering with our game viewing experience on account of what ?  A part of me wonders if he was just mad that my entire table was one of the few tables present that was rooting for the Brazilian team , as most of the other Patrons were rooting for Colombia.      We could have opted to stay at the place because the server was very gracious and apologetic and she came over and was sincere in her apology on his behalf , however even if it meant missing some minutes of the game , you better believe I was not going to stay there and order more food , and drinks , and bring more people over to give the establishment more business after the way in which he conducted himself . As I told him , if he plans to stay in business he needs a serious attitude adjustment because that is not how you do business and it's a quick way to lose customers.      Needless to say I don't plan to go back and I will post this review in as many forums as possible , because I strongly feel that this was the epitome of terrible service by this establishment .  I still did the right thing and tipped our server since after all it wasn't her fault , I canceled the order for the Tacos , paid the bill , waited for my friends who showed up 5 minutes later , and ran out of that place saying Good Riddance !!!!      As they say everything happens for a reason , my group and I ended up going to a pub on the other side of Queens Boulevard where the majority of the patrons were rooting for Brazil, everybody was friendly and we had a blast watching the rest of the game .      Do yourself a favor , do not go here ....and If you do , don't let them empty your table or you face the possibility of being asked to leave ... you've been warned .","Minerva S."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2015-04-05","This is a fun spot for a quick bite.  I've been here a number of times and service has always been good.  The drinks are good, in particular the margaritas.  However, I am not a fan of the mojitos served in ice cream sundae glasses.  Rethinking the menu, though, is what would help this place the most.  Although there is an ample selection, I have always thought that the dishes were not that great.  What I like the most is the California burrito (spinach enchiladas are good).  I wasn't too thrilled with the chile relleno.  Overall, a good place for a relaxed and easy dinner or lunch.","Rebel H."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2012-01-27","I've taken a couple of out of town friends here who were in the mood for Mexican and sangria.  The flauntas were delicious and filling since I didn't want a big meal. The sangria was okay - it was a little sweeter than I would've liked but their mojitos are good. I hope to come back one night for happy hour!  My biggest complaint is how loud the music got...perhaps it turns into a lounge at night because I could barely hear my friend talking....and I'm getting old so I don't like the loud music as much anymore. I also went to the UES location and our friend raved about the mole saying it was the best he'd ever had.","Megan P."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2014-06-27","Horrible service!!  We went there to celebrate my sister's graduation... We got there and asked for some water right away and placed our drinks order .. some one will come to as 10 mins later to take our drinks and food order again other 10 mins will pass by and the same waitress came up to ask for id's, 30 mins will pass by since we got there and we haven't get more than water... Of course we decided to leave after a half hour waiting n taking enough acctitud from another employee who was asked to stabilized our mumbling table which never happened... Not planing to come back until They finally hire a real bartender so the chef won't have to come out and replace the barman.","Edwin Q."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2012-06-07","Stopped in on a Friday night.  Two seats at the bar, two margaritas, two entrees of mexican deliciousoness and even two shots on our way out.  Oh yeah, and guacamole.  Duh.  The bartender was pretty friendly, a little busy with some visiting friends or regulars? but didn't fail to meet my expectations.  The guacamole, a different story- pretty bland? which I thought was hard to fail at for a 'genuine' mexican restaurant. Overall, a 4.  I will most likely be back when I'm craving Mexican in Sunnyside.","Brittany L."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2014-07-20","I came here once when I first moved in to Sunnyside then ordered online and again this past week. While I think their margaritas are on point, I don't really like the food because it's pretty bland. I keep giving this place the benefit of the doubt because the place looks nice. Overall I think if you want good margaritas and some simple appetizers like their calamari or wings or nachos, then this place is good for that. If you're looking for some good Mexican flavors, then don't come here.","XtiAn A."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2013-09-23","Dallas BBQ Texas sized cups?! Yes they have them, greatness! I came here Friday night with some friends since we were around the area.  We just dropped in, it wasn't a planned thing, the music was calling us... People were eating here but I wasn't in the mood for eating, we had just wanted to go out for some drinks and dancing.  And that's what we did.  Had some good Amaretto Sours here so we're good in the drinks department. The music was mixed, top 40s, hip hop, salsa, merengue, bachata, cumbia, house, yeah it was a little bit of everything for everyone.  it's a narrow spot but a lot of space for dancing although it was pretty packed at certain points of the night. Service was swift and attentive, that's what we like. The girls were sweet too, and honestly most of the time female waitresses or bartenders aren't really friendly with a group of girls but the girls here were pretty nice!  Bouncer at the door was pretty cool dude too, laid back but attentive to any potential problems.  Crowd was older, everyone was doing their own thing, having fun.  A couple of sugar daddies, woof... *runs away*   Not really my style but it was an alright spot to end up in!","Yulissa V."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2015-05-23","I loved this place bc its only a block away from my house n the drinks r great..... I give 4stars on the drinks.... BUT..... Including yesterday, this is MY SECOND time getting food poisoning from eating there.... First time i had ordered Chicken Fajita. I didnt taste or smell anything funny, so as usual being hungry, i ate it all. Around 3am i woke up wanting vomit... N i ended up puking for about 7times.... Of course i was dehydrated n weak from throwing up so i ended up missing work for two days. Yesterday, my hubs wanted to take me there bc i had a long week n it was only thursday. We went n were excited bc we never took advantage of their pre fix menu or any special drinks bc wed always come after hours. I ordered Chicken burrito, soup, fried ice cream & frozen strawberry coolata. Everything seemed fine n was delicious! It was so much i had to doggy bag. When i was about to go to bed that night, i felt a slight indigestion & nausea but i thought i could just sleep it off. I woke up @2AM n started throwing up. Im NOT kidding but i threw up literally about 30times between 2-9am.... It was to the point where i threw up everything that ive eaten since that morning n nothing else was left in my intestine but i was still throwing up acid..... I almost passed out after vomiting so much bc i hurled way too many times.... My friend whos a pharmacist sent over some meds THEN i was able to finally sleep n stop vomiting.... I dont think ill ever order food there in the future but mebbe just drinks.... Twice was just enough.....","Hallie C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2011-05-23","I went here when it opens and it was a real sh*t show with people puking all over the place from the free margaritas and shots they gave out. Went here last weekend and it looks like they never cleaned up since then.  One reason to go here is the really strong margaritas $5 happy hours. But the food has always been mediocre. Well, this weekend it was still mediocre but just dirty.  Despite its A rating given in Nov 2010 as we entered the place we saw the booth seating littered with crumbs and debris, what I though was lamination on the tables turned out to be shiny and sticking film on it.  Anyway we got fajitas, Her has what seemed to be a PUBIC HAIR in it and we stopped eating immediately. FOOD POISONING. That nite I got sick from the food as well. She hardly ate her meal they took it back but still charged us and gave a 15% discount on the check. Its really F*cking gross. I had steak fajitas and they came out like room temp like they were microwaved insufficently.  Don't eat the food. I would be skeptical of the margaritas cleaniness as well except their tequila which resembles turpentine probably disinfects. I checked the rating of their two other restaurants one got 51 points which usually merits CLOSING cause of health violation and the other got 21 points which I think is a C rating.  DIRTY, DIRTY... will not be going there anymore. Overpriced anyway I try to check any restaurant I got to on the DOH restaurant inspection website just to make sure  Margatias to pack a good buzz but so does those $5 plastic bottle gallon jugs of Tequila if thats your taste","Joe C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2014-04-08","I was here on 28/03/14.. Liked the place and food. Got the bill . We were 3 so we split in 3 and one was paying by cash. The waitress comes back saying she swiped my card 2 different amounts by mistake (16$ and 34.42$) and said she would void the 34$. Ok no harm done. Mistakes do happen. Ten days later i check my bank statement, nope no amount returned! I went there yesterday and after waiting for 20mins they come back saying the manager will call me today. And guess what? He did not! Am i suppose to ignore that they just conveniently decided not to return my money! I went out of my way from chelsea to sunnyside andi need to go yet again tmr since they are just happy to steal my money. You suck arriba arriba! Had i not checked, i wouldn't be aware they haven't voided the second bill.","Ensia M."

Perfect sizes because I was full but not stuffed that my stomach hurt. I gave my drink to my friend but their margaritas are good.","Alexis S."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2013-06-14","Went a couple times and both times had the guac. which was delicious. Being a vegetarian I tried the mushroom enchilada and the spinach enchilada. Mushroom over spinach if you had to choose. Wasnt too great and would order these two again. The drinks are good. I know a lot of people usually come here after work for the happy hour. BTW they are a little pricey. The guac was almost 10$ and it was small. Our waitress was very accomadating and nice! It was raining that night and freezing out but they seemed to have the windows/doors open which i hated but eventually was closed midway through our stay.  Overall i say try this place. I WOULD DEF RETURN! but not for their spinach enchiladas. Just not my taste.","Rochelle R."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2014-08-11","I thought this place was great. From the drinks to the food to the service.

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2014-08-11","We've been coming here semi-regularly for the past 2 years. The food is consistently good and attractively plated. The flavors aren't going to blow your mind, but it's still good stuff.  We always sit at the bar because Sasha treats us like royalty. He's a big reason why we keep going back.  Sangria is tasty, and you'll need it...the place always feels a little overheated. That's my only complaint.","Ms. F."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2013-10-24","you will not be disappointed, it is not often you eat what i can only call gourmet Mexican food.  so this place is not big and don't sit by the door on a cold night because it has a terrible draft. but that is the only downfall the bar makes amazing drinks 1 class of sangria or Margarita and you are good for a few hours, very strong but not enough to have you stumble out wasted the food is always fresh my favorite is the shrimp quesdilla but i have had every enchilada they sell and each one is better than the last.  it is a very trendy vibe with great music on the weekend, it turns into more of a lounge than a restaurant.  i make the trip to enjoy a great night of food here.","Erika C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2013-03-05","LOVE the chicken parilla. SO MUCH CHICKEN. Almost too much, so make sure you either share, prepare for a doggy bag or bring your appetite. Their Chicken Tortilla soup is amazing. Tons of fresh veggies, chicken, and....SALT!  I'd caution you on the Skinny Margaritas if you are looking for bang for your buck. Not too much liquor in them. In fact, not too much liquid, either. It's more of cup of ice with some stuff in it. Also, if you order delivery I'd advise that you not order the $8.95 half a cup of guacamole. It's good, but the portion size is ridiculous and leaves you with a huge bag of chips for nothing.  Service? Meh. They are not concerned about checking on you more than twice during your stay, regardless of how much $ you are forking over. Also, make sure YOU are aware of the happy hour specials listed outside, because they are not about to share that information with you when taking your order. Rude. To sum things up, great food but not good  value and definitely not great service. If you can put up with all that you're fine. If not, check out a taco stand and get yourself a bottle of tequila to take home with you.","Melissa K."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2012-10-03","It's pretty good.  Not the BEST, but not the worst.  There isn't a lot of competition in the neighborhood.  The talames were excellent and their margaritas will mess you up.  It's what I like to think of as 'nice clean Mexican' or very Americanized.  Which a lot of people love; and the food is GOOD.  Just not that special.","Stephanie M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2012-03-03","Terrible and slow service. It wasn't even that crowded and the waiter took forever to come to our table and forever to get our food.

I sometimes come here for happy hour, but I think I will just stick to that.","Mai Y."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2012-04-14","My friend and I were around the area on a Saturday and we were hungry for lunch.  We were walking and decided to eat in here.  The interior looks pretty nice with a bar to the left.  Since there wasnt many customers at 1pm, we were seated immediately.   Once we were seated, we were given three menus.  First one was their regular menu.  Second one was their chef special menu.  Third one was their weekend brunch menu.    There were so many selections that we couldnt decide on what we wanted.  Finally, my friend and I decided to order something from the weekend brunch menu.  The weekend brunch menu includes a selection of one of few drinks with your meal.  The drinks were bloody mary, frozen margarita, sangria, or soft drinks. I ordered the Breakfast Arriba and Sangria for drink.  My friend ordered the Arriba Chicken Fajitas and ginger ale for drink. They serve us the Sangra and ginger ale first.  The Sangria didnt taste good.  It was water down.  The ginger ale was flat.  It taste water down as well. We waited 30 minutes until the food came out.  We told each other that this better be worth the wait.  Boy, we were so wrong.  The food was warm/cold.  The only thing that was hot were my fries.  It was very disappointing.","Howie C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2012-12-17","Writing this from the table... Food was ok. Paid out of my butt for two, but it wasn't bad. Service was subpar at best. We had a large group and had 20% added for tip, which was based on our total AFTER tax (this is illegal). Also was not told until bill was figured out that restaurant would not process more than 3 credit cards at a time. Frustrating experience for average food and margaritas at best. I will definitely NOT be back under any circumstance. Disappointing, even for NYC, where I've had plenty of bad experiences.","Rich M."

The service is good and food equally delicious. There is a blond girl that I keep on getting as a waitress I wish I knew her name to give her a shout out cause she is always soo attentive, so to the owners of the Arriba in Sunnyside take note that the blond with long hair is one of your best staff.

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2011-02-06","Disclaimer: what I'm about to relate is limited to a kind of one-in-a-lifetime visit to this restaurant that will probably never happen again. Excuse my bias. For those of you not looking for a story, scroll down for the 'facts' (though we know there never really is one 'truth'...but enough with my literary rants). So it's Saturday night and my boyfriend and I are looking for a place to eat in Sunnyside. I live in Sunnyside but I've never really given myself the chance to explore the neighborhood. So we ask my roommate for a place she can recommend, having lived in the area for 7+ years. Pete's Diner. Blegh! Sorry, it's a thing I have with diners and their dirty rags to clean tables and that rag/rat smell that permeates the floors. [I've never been to Pete's Diner---this is NOT a review of Pete's diner...these are my own biases with these kinds of places]. We blow her suggestion off and decide to walk the neighborhood [Queens Blvd].  It's raining, and hardly any place is open. We see some Christmas-looking lights and wonder what's inside. There's an f'ing fiesta going on in there! Music is booming, not packed but lively. A little private party in the back. Usually I don't like to eat dinner where I'm facing a DJ in a booth but I was so happy to just be with PEOPLE and to get outside of the rain that I didn't mind Montell Jordan telling me 'This is how we do it'. It was actually a pretty good mix the DJ had going there.  We get in and we're greeted by an Indian guido---seriously, this guy was wearing sunglasses inside of the restaurant. I ask him if he works there. He says no. But then he tells the server to take us to the best table and to give us the best treatment...that we're with him. WHATT?? So we're like, ok, I guess he doesss work here? Because the waiter complied. So this guy keeps coming over the table and telling us to get whatever we want, asking us to eat food from his plate as he's walking around talking to people, bringing them over to our table, introducing us as his close friends and my boyfriend as his brother [he's Indian too]. And we're just having fun with it and going along with the whole thing. Meanwhile, I'm getting some salsa on my chips when I hear/feel a loud thud on the ground in front of me---his 300lb friend had just finished doing a cartwheel. A cartwheel! Like in the middle of the bar. 300lb! This is not a cheerleader but a grown, fat man. It was incredible. We ate it up. It was like Cirque du Soleil on a rainy Saturday night you don't expect anything out of. The best thing about the cartwheel? It was so non-chalant, like, he didn't even look up to see if anyone was looking. He did it because he felt like it and went on to resume his drink. And that sums up the entire ambiance of the place. Though it seems like one of those places where you have to wear certain clothes, look a certain way---it is NOT. Far from it. I had literally rolled off my bed and put on a sweatshirt---and I felt completely comfortable in that place. So there are cartwheels going on, the 'host' keeps coming with more people, 'my brother' this, 'my brother' that. More people are coming in. At this point, we had three people next to our table---a couple and a third person, male. He suddenly gets up, takes off his coat to reveal a muscular figure sporting a little, tight white wife-beater, and starts dancing. Like right next to his table---alone---while the couple sat tight and immersed in conversation. He's just looking up at the ceiling with his arms spread apart, hands in fists, and he's dancing to the music side to side. Like imagine Donkey Kong standing right next to a table, swaying side to side. It was surreal! Cartwheel strolls over and starts imitating him [because it really was the funniest sight!] and they both just laugh and high-five each other. It was the friendliest, most neighborhood thing you'll ever see in NYC.  So the whole time we're being told by the main guy to order whatever we want, not to worry. So my boyfriend and I are wondering what's going to happen when the bill comes around. Is he really going to give us a discount, does he even work there, can anyone else even see him but us, are we dreaming, did we take drugs? Finally it comes around and 20 has been marked off, coming down to like 13 dollars for the whole experience. We asked the waitress if she even knew who he was and she said she had no idea. He later came by and took a picture with us at our table. We're surely posted on FB somewhere, with the caption reading, 'my brother and his girl'. Eh, if that's who we have to be to get a free-ish meal, we're in! And now for the 'Facts': So Arriba Arriba is a Mexican restaurant as I understand it so I was super surprised to find a Peruvian menu in there! I've never been to a Per-Mex restaurant before! That was a real delight. I had the Chicken a la Parrilla. It was ok. My boyfriend had one of the sausage empanadas---absoutely delicious!","Anne L."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2009-04-05","I don't generally like the vibe of this place.  They can't make up their mind if they want to be a sports bar, a night club, or a nice restaurant in Queens.  I applaud the opening of more nice restaurants in Sunnyside, but I won't come to this place for dinner.  It's way to loud to even try to have a conversation while you're eating, and the service is slow. However, the brunch food is fantastic.  It is never full for brunch and they don't have the music cranked.  The huevos rancheros portions are ample (they filled me up), and the included drink makes it a nice value.","Chad T."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2011-01-15","What I like about AA is their banana margarita's.  I usually begin my evening at Arriba Arriba with a nice banana margarita.  I've been to AA at least 5x.  I usually go for drinks along with chips and salsa.  I've order Tamale appetizers on occasion, and they were okay.   Arriba Arriba has a friendly crew.  On Friday and Saturday nights, they have a DJ.  It's not my style of music, but the DJ seems to entertain the crowd. One of my best experiences at Arriba Arriba was in June 2010.   AA hosted a fashion show, in which my friend was the participating designer.","Jessica J."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2011-05-05","The food is delicious -- fresh, hearty, flavorful. It's great. The margaritas are good, too. Not too weak, not too strong. But the service --- forget about it. It's so bad that it takes away from the deliciousness of the food. Was just there for cinco de mayo and was not pleased at all... they told my friends and i we could only sit if we ordered food, so one friend decided to order food... by this time we already had our drinks and were told that we needed to order a minimum price in order to keep the table... and they ASKED US TO GET UP !  there we were, squished next to the bar.... and were again asked to move. It's very cramped in there and the staff doesn't seem to have a handle on moving around in a tight space, which seems unfortunate. I'd suggest going on a quiet evening or ordering delivery... stay away from this place on special occasions, especially. The California Burrito is top notch (so is the guacamole).","Stephanie G."

And The Food is Good!","Christine M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2014-08-12","Food was tasty, drinks were really good especially the margaritas with no flavor. Not crowded at all. I heard it becomes a lounge at nighttime with hookah and stuff. I was there on a Wednesday afternoon about 6 PM having drinks with my friend for her birthday, we were there until almost after 10 PM, The server was Cool, they extended our happy hour for having a party of six because they did not give us the deals that were shown on Facebook.","Sil A."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2009-08-18","Brunch....... GOOD. Dinner...... BAD. Yes I'm 5 years old.  Food is pretty decent, but you've had it all before somewhere else. There is absolutely nothing, NOTHING, that would make me want to ever go back here for dinner. They think it's a fine restaurant, sports bar and extremely loud night club all in one. It's like a 45 year old man going through an identity crisis.  Brunch is the polar opposite. Place is quiet, has seating and a good value brunch special with a 'free' drink. I recommend the Quick Paella for something a little different but there are a lot of solid choices. Service can be slow regardless of what time you go so if you want the check be sure to tell them.","Ryan M."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2011-05-30","Why oh why did I waltz into Arriba Arriba without reading Yelp reviews first?  Oh mistake.  BIG mistake.  So my roommate and I were scouting places with outdoor seating or at least open air seating and we walk by Arriba Arriba.  Look, a perfect table right by the non-window, practically outside and $5 happy hour drinks - perfect! We sit, are immediately brought free chips and salsa (which is one of the more flavorful items we tried I might add.)  We both decided on enchiladas and guac and chips to start - it was $9, but for me its really hard to go to a Mexican restaurant and not have avocado flavor explosion to munch on with my cocktail while I'm waiting for a feast.  So it comes out, and its a large-ish proportion but ZERO flavor.  Very tomatoey, and could detect hardly a hint of garlic, onions or and sense of zest.. completely boring.  Worse than a packet from the grocery store.  We tried eating it in-between bites of the slightly more flavorful salsa.. but it just sucked.  So AFTER our entrees arrived we sent the guac back. Enchiladas.  Not good.  Luke warm, sauce seemed to be a bit crusted on there like it had been sitting out.  Pretty bland, not very cheesy.  Rice and beans were basically microwave dinners on a plate.  Wrong.  I was so wrong to pay $13 for a window seat entree.  Service was good, and our lady took the guac off our bill which was appreciated.  Ambiance wise, felt like a sports bar with TVs. An ok place for $5 happy hour drinks and free chips and salsa, a terrible place for meals.  If you are looking for real deal yummy Mexican cuisine this is absolutely not your place.  Try De Mole, it will make your heart sing.","Amanda H."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2011-03-21","On Monday and Tuesday, they have a prixe-fix menu that includes a drink (frozen margarita, sangria, domestic beer, or sooda), appetizer and entree for $14.95. That said, the prixe-fix special is the only reason I'd come back here (or possibly to try those amazing looking margaritas and skip the food). The bf and I wandered in here after a long day at work and were surprised to see such an awesome deal. I got a sangria, four salsa chips covered in cheese and beans (ummm, they were the 'cheese nachos') and a steak fajita for $15! I can't complain about that at all.  Customer service however, could be greatly improved. Our waitress was likeable enough, but definitely looked like she would've rather been someplace else. It just didn't feel like a spot I'd come back to support in our little neighborhood of Sunnyside, when there are other restaurants with much more stellar food and service.  This is not the place you come for good Mexican food...or customer service. This is the type of place that you come to watch games, order stale chips from a bag and dip them in so-so salsa, and drink to your heart's content.","Nicole A."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2012-01-25","Ugh, I used to come here a lot for the cheap happy hour frozen margaritas. The food was pretty hit-or-miss, and felt a bit expensive, and the service was pretty aloof and sluggish. Still, the cheap margaritas were worth it. Lately, it's a lot worse: the food is downright mediocre, service is truly lame (lazy, inattentive, and sloppy), AND the frozen margaritas tend to be kind of foamy and not delicious. So now I just don't go there at all.","Sarah K."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2013-05-07","I really like this place, we go here over and over again!  Solid restaurant, decent service, good food, clean, many choices on the menu.  Good chips and salsa.  Not expensive.  What more can you ask for?  Go there tonight!","Angela S."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2013-05-07","Good not great Mexican food some items are really good others not so much that's why the 3 stars if they were more consistent it would be better and a little pricey considering you can get better tacos of your local taco truck, but overall not bad if you pick the correct items like there Tortas.

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2009-11-04","Writing a negative review is not fun. It usually is divvied up to 60% venting, 30% exacting revenge and 10% personal accounts. I will try to be partial and reverse it with different ratios. I had very slow service considering there were only four people in the place and a wait staff of 3, (plus a bartender and two kitchen staff). The busboy brought out my entree first and then apologized and brought my soup.  The waitress was unaware of the issue and then I was assigned an new waitress mid-dinner. O.K., Nothing any other restaurant might not experience however, when I tasted the food, it was bland and the rice was dry, the salsa tasted exactly like store bought and the black bean soup was boring. I finished half of my food before discovering hair in my plate at which point I left. The only redeeming quality this place has is its bar and the tiny chips that taste freshly cooked.","Roman C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2009-10-05","Very nice servers here, although perhaps a bit clueless to help with those unfamiliar with the menu (psst.. that would be me) In any case, the ground beef enchilada I got was very good. I got to sub the rice and beans with wild rice and brocolli (which was more underdone than I'd like, but fine) Sangria was delicious, but I do wish the prices here were a bit more reasonable, especially since most restaurants in Sunnyside, if they are not 'top-notch,' are usually more wallet friendly.  Caution: in warm weather, do not sit by the window thinking you'd have a great view for enjoying the sunset or people watching... the frequent arrivals and departures of the bus directly in front will soon ruin the little romantic atmosphere you set out to create.","Wendy L."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2009-11-28","I'm going to keep this short and sweet; 1. This place is *only* good for drinks. And the bartender mixes a good drink.  2. Their food is some of the worst I have ever had. I am not a picky eater, and I eat almost anything - believe me I am not one of those 'every-single-little-thing' bothers me kind of a gal. But when I received my taco salad and the meat smelled/tasted a day old, on top of basically being a Hamburger Helper recipe well I had about all I could take.  The service was fine, drink are kickin', but don't *ever* eat there. Trust me.","Allessandra C."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2011-04-16","Though moderately priced, the food here was not remotely authentic and not  good.  I had the steak fajitas with the steak being fatty, with gristle and and barely present amongst the green pepper and onion.  It was almost as if I was given someone else's leftover plate with barely any meat left. The mimosa's were really just glasses of orange juice and the coffee was weak and bitter. The service was ok with the staff being congenial but on the slow side.   This might be a place just to have a drink but I'm afraid I won't be returning.","Robert G."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2013-02-12","Don't like it at all, had steak and vegetables couldn't eat any was way to salty, i ordered medium rare and got well done. Margaritas are weak..","Bisbirusdolfa S."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2011-11-24","This is the place my coworkers go to because it's only a block away from our job. We love this place. The staff is on point, drinks are good and food is reasonable. After last night's experience however, I will never go back. My group and I went for Wacky Wednesday ($3 Sangria, Margarita and domestic beer) and after ordering our third round, we were told by the server that the drinks were actually $5, not $3 because it was suspended for the upcoming holiday. (What!? If anything, you should have better specials for the holidays!) The server apologized and said that he had not been informed until now. After complaining to management, they agreed to give it to us for the $3 price. Two seconds after that, management took our server and started to berate him in front of all the customers. Outraged by the treatment to our server, who has always been very kind and gracious, my friends and I went up to the owner and demanded that he apologize to the server, considering he hadn't been told. The owner simply said, it's no sweat off your back, why are you making a big deal? After a long argument, going back and forth with the owner, he continued to disrespect the server and in turn, we also felt disrespected. Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened to us. On a prior occasion, my friends and I sat at the bar and there was a half full beer bottle in one of the middle seats. We moved it over, assuming the patron had left. He returned and started giving us hell about moving his drink and we kindly asked if he could move over so that our group could sit together. He started slinging some curse words our way and when we complained to management, all they said was 'well, he WAS sitting there first' completely ignoring the fact that he was being rude. After we threatened to leave with our group of ~25, management finally came to their senses and offered us a free house shot and kindly asked the gentleman to move because another place had cleared on the bar. So, if good drinks are important to you, go to Arriba Arriba. If reasonable food is important for you, go to Arriba Arriba. If respectful management is important to you, go somewhere else.","Asmika D."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2014-02-21","This is real deal for mexican food lovers out there like me. The guacamole is a bit pricey for the amount, but tastes amazing.

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2010-07-18","I think I need to come to Queens more often.  Surprising nice place and pretty good service.  The menu is pretty big with tons of options from authentic tacos and burritos to flautas and enchiladas.  I of course had to have the tacos, namely the puebla tacos in an awesome mole sauce.  They were awesome and I would definitely come back just for that.  They also had a sweet summer drink special - sangria and frozen margarita mixed together with a coronita sticking out from the top.  2 of these and some tacos and I'm set!!","Eric B."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2010-09-02","I've gotten way to drunk here twice from those fish bowl sized margaritas. Staff is pretty cool but the patrons are fairly douchie. Myself included after a couple of those fish bowl margaritas.  Food is an obnoxious attempt at hip, but that isn't really what we care about when we want Mexican is it folks? Second time I ate here my food was screwed up, I can't remember why exactly, but I tasted it and sent it back and they still charged me for it. The waitress 'had to ask the owner'. He blatantly told her to still charge me for it. The best part of this is the fact that I met the guy once.( I think I was a douche after those margaritas) I talked to him and he reluctantly took it off our check. Needless to say, everyone went home annoyed that evening.","Cat W."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2012-04-18","The food was definitely flavorful (I had the pollo asado and my friend had the tamale with mole and chicken), however the service was slow even though it wasn't busy.

I'm told that certain nights they have dancing and that can be a favorite for some people in the neighborhood.","Yvonne L."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2011-11-17","Oh Arriba:( You used to be my favorite place to go. I was so addicted to the pomegranate margaritas and food I would bring everyone I knew.  The quality kept sliding all summer to the point where my neighbor and I haven't been back for months. The service is retardedly slow and the food and drinks are almost inedible now.  I had an upchuck reaction to the chicken tacos and guacamole that tasted like fish.  And the main draw that kept me coming back, the pom margarita, tasted like medicine. The tostadas used to have fresh vegetables, last time they looked like scrapings. The platanos were like sugar caramelized candy delicious, last night they were so mushy I thought they had been regurgitated, and resembled the snake monsters in Tremors. The bald round waiter that used to be there every day wasn't there and I was glad because on my last visit he was so awful I did a lot of the service myself, It took 40 minutes for a house salad and when it arrived shortly after I finally asked, we had no silverware and when we requested a knife, fork, and share plates he nodded and disappeared to sing happy birthday to someone in the dj booth. I was embarrassed of the whole experience after talking the place up:( I'm sad to say last night's disgusting food and drink experience and the crying bartender who was nice at first but like Arriba slowly began to disappoint, will not convince me to return.  Arriba I miss the good ole days last year.","pmrkrd p."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2009-10-05","OK.  I live around the corner from Arriba. I have gone there so many times. It is so awesome.  Happy Hour: 4-7 EVERY DAY and ALL DAY Mondays and Tuesdays. Margaritas are $5!!! They are so good! You will be drunk!! The Happy Hour price is only available at the bar, and is only for regular, frozen margaritas. But this is what you should be drinking. They are really good. Really strong.  The food is really, really good. I had my first only 'so-so' meal there just last week. I have eaten there many times and it has always been incredible. Recommendations: the veggie or mushroom quesadillas are amazing. The nachos are incredible. They aren't on the menu, but if you order them, you will not be disappointed. The Mama Burrito is also quite good.  This place is relatively new, and the menu has been constantly morphing since its opening, thus the confusion by one or two-time diners.  The wait staff is really friendly, although also constantly changing. The ambience is definitely different for Sunnyside, which I think is one of this restaurant's perks. It's an interesting, city-esque atmosphere with a totally Queens, small-town, local vibe.  All in all, Arriba is a great place to drink and eat. Have fun.","p e."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2009-06-26","The food here is great. In fact, I would give it props for not having your stereotypical Tex Mex food especially given that it looks like it would be. Therein lies the problem. Although it has a nice open front for the warmer months, Arriba Arriba is more like a bar inside than a restaurant. Large Tvs dangle over the dominant bar, and loud hits blare out over the speakers. It was almost impossible to carry on a conversation.  Like a bar, Arriba Arriba takes justifiable pride in their margaritas, and those--like the food--were quite good. However, the service was quite slow too. It took forever to get a bill and change, preoccupied were our servers behind the bar. A final complaint, the chips that come with the salsa are so tiny, and why so few? Why so stingy??? Despite the good food I don't think I will be back. It's like being interested in a woman from another country but finding out she's at heart a sorority girl.","Geoff O."

We ordered from their brunch menu which they did not have the dish I wanted which  could not understand considering I wanted a mexican sandwhich which was grilled chicken with toppings. How do you not have grilled chicken???? Very weird. Although they had chicken for the fajitas that I ended up ordering after. Their sangria was refreshing. It was a nice quick bite before the spa but I just didn't understand how they were out of mexican sandwhich.","Beatrice C."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2009-03-05","I know you might be able to get comparably good Mexican in many places throughout Queens and Manhattan, but I defy you to find nicer service, more carful presentation, or better value for your experience.  I used to go the Arriba Arriba Upper East Side when I lived there, and I was thrilled to see they were opening one down the street from my new outer borough digs.  I went with my boyfriend on Valentine's Day a few weeks ago, and I couldn't wait to rave about it.  The BF had the California Burrito (yum! And lovely presentation, which is rare with burritos) I had green enchiladas, which were terrifically tangy and delicious.  The Guacamole is good, if a tad small.  Above all, the Margaritas are amazing.  Frozen or on the rocks, flavored or plain, they are good, not too sweet, and strong (but still tasty).

All seemed to be pretty mixed so we decided to just walk and check out the vibe of a few.. Ultimately we ended up here because the menu looked better, and for a friday night this was just the kind of atmosphere we were looking for. We ordered to guacamole to start, which they made table-side to our liking (extra spicy). For entrees I got the chile relleno w chicken, my boyfriend had the grilled salmon parrilla. My relleno was good but it had (no exaggeration) 1/2 inch of cheese melted on it.. i literally peeled it off and set it aside. the sauce that it came with was reallly good and spicy. My boyfriend enjoyed his dish, and from the bite I had the salmon seemed fresh. The service was friendly and attentive. Margaritas are good.. I had the skinny girl (nice to see that they offer the less sugar options) and it was fairly strong. Dessert was a downfall.. 'fried' ice cream was nothing more than a ball of vanilla ice cream rolled in corn flakes with honey on top. I grew up going to a restaurant that was infamous for fried ice cream so this was upsetting to my high hopes of a childhood pleasure.  all in all, enjoyable on a friday night. I would return but, based on other reviews, it would be on a busy weekend night when it seems they are more on their game.","Katie B."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2009-06-28","Arriba Arriba ..... Abajo Abajo ( High High ... Low Low) Fathers Day is Dads turn to choose the cuisine and he wanted Mexican. So once his friends mentioned Arriba Arriba the choice was made.  Location: On the quite side of Queens Blvd. Plenty of Muni-meter parking available across the street. There should be no problem getting a spot on the weekends. Easily accessible to the BQE and LIE expressways. Restaurant: Great lounge ambiance with a bit of Indigenous flair. We sat by the open patio door which i hated but kept quite about. (The bus stop is like right in your face) Shortly after we got our chips(warm and taste) and salsa ( a bit spicy but i enjoyed it) and looked through the five- page menu. So it was time to order and I was feeling a bit scared about the place from seeing other orders come out. I asked my sister is this place Asian-Mexican Fusion Cuisine? She said 'no looks like just Mexican to me.' To which i replied ' Imma have a Quesadilla. That's Simple.' So are waiter which was boring as seeing paint dry came and took our orders. I got the aforementioned and a Sangria -Margarita on the rocks.  Food: The food is served on those square modern white plates. For a moment i felt I was once again in a Asian-Mexican fusion restaurant. My sister got the Steak Fajitas. The portion was small and the stemming fajitas had broccoli. That's a first! As for me I enjoyed my Quesadilla ($9) but feel that the grill chicken would of been a better choice. It came with guacamole and some salad. On a side note the black beans were Delicious... I had some from dads.   I have to be honest and say that I would encourage you to go out and give it a try. But remember what I said about that Asian-Fusion feeling and leave me a comment.... LOL Near by: A short drive to UA Kaufman Studio Cinema 14, Museum of the Moving Image and the Queensboro 59th Street Bridge.  40th Street and Queens Blvd stop on the 7 Train.

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2013-01-08","The reason I give this place two stars is because the service was really bad. I'm not a picky person but the waiter I had made feel rushed and very uncomfortable. Uncomfortable to the point I wanted to leave .... He was rude and I almost felt like he didn't even want to be there because he looked so miserable....  I have never been there on a Sunday but  he ruined my experience... With that being said the food was good and the sangria adds a nice touch to the meal.","Isadora M."

The service is so friendly, and all of the bartenders and staff always talk to me in Spanish!! very cute. (I study Spanish) Their margaritas are nice and strong. I recommend the coconut, I don't even like coconut but this margarita is the best. Their food is really good too, especially their guacamole. I bought it for a party I was throwing and my friends loved it. Olé!!","Kristin Y."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",2,"2010-05-11","It wasn't bad.  When Chips first opened up next to the movie theater, that was the best Mexican place in Sunnyside.  The food was authentic, refined, and most importantly, it was delicious!  Then they changed owners and it sucked.  I've been waiting a long time for a good Mexican restaurant and AA  (not alcoholics anonymous, but Arriba Arriba) was disappointing.  I ordered  the chicken chimichangas, and I swear it was a burrito.  That was strike one, strike two: there were bones in my chimichanga.  Strike three: customer service was not the best.  I guess it's too hard to be friendly.  And...this was easily the weirdest part, they sprinkled Parmesan cheese not only on my chimichanga, but on the beans too!  I'm Italian, I love Parmesan cheese, but it has no place on chimichangas.  There was one positive, however, the food has some flavor.  It's not bad at all, just don't expect anything.","Charles P."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",3,"2012-05-29","Went on the Monday of memorial day around 3 pm when it was 87 degrees outside. They did not have the air conditioner on and had two ceiling fans going. When we asked to put the AC on, they looked at us as if we were strange. Had the happy hour sangria and a burrito with chorizo. It seemed all good, but can't really tell you since the sweat was pouring off of us and we almost became delusional from the oppressive heat. They also forgot to bring us our guacomole. Will try again in the winter, because I am not making the trip out there to sweat on my food.","Irene W."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2012-06-08","We were seated for 15 minutes before being acknowledged by our server. I wish we had left then. Server was lackadaisical, and forgot one of our orders and a side. Never apologized, blamed us. I'm sorry, but if there are four people at the table and you only bring out three entrees, then obviously you forgot an order.  The kicker was the bill at the end. We ordered a burrito with beans and cheese only. The waitress charged us for the most expensive burrito on the menu.  Complaining to the management did nothing. There are so many better restaurants out there with better food, better service, and better prices.  Stay away from this place.","J D."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2012-05-07","I would call this comfort-mexican.  Not the most super authentic mexican fare- more like tex-mex, but still super enjoyable.  Sometimes you just get a craving for tex-mex, and they fill that need pretty well.

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2010-10-26","I've been to Arriba Arriba twice and both times I ordered the same thing- as appetizer I had the ceviche from the weekend specials, and fried calamari. The first time the ceviche was really good, but the second time they mixed the ceviche with mint. Now, I AM a ceviche expert, and I've never had a ceviche as bad as I did that day at Arriba Arriba. I couldn't really taste the fish, it was all mint. The fried calamari are insanely good! The orange-ish sauce is just perfection; and the calamari tastes so fresh and are easy to chew. As main course I had... I ordered... sh*t! I forgot the names! I'm looking at the menu but I don't see any of the dishes I ordered; perhaps I have the old one. Anyway, I think one was called Mussels Jarochos (for 2), another one, I think it was The Roasted Duck Taquitos, and finally, something with lamb or goat. Jeez, I started this review about a month a ago and I'm just finishing up now. Overall, a mi me gusta mucho Arriba Arriba! VIVA LA REVOLUCION!","Angela M."

And the beans and rice are vegetarian.  I love the food, the servers/staff/owners are all friendly and they will make any substitution you want.  Very rare for a restaurant to allow such substitutions, this just shows everything is fresh and made to order instead of pre-made and heated.","Stephanie S."

I went for brunch twice and once had a dish with eggs that made me nauseous, and the other other time I have fajitas which were pretty good in contrast.  The guacamole is good and so are the margaritas.  I think you just have to be careful with what you pick to eat off the menu.","Mush B."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2011-08-21","I HIGHLY recommend only eating from this place if you're doing take out. Don't even bother walking in there, just order from them off grubhub or seemlessweb. This place is so outrageously loud it's ridiculous. My friend and I went in for a local girls night out. Now, the margaritas were SUPER strong (you could see the tequila and juice separate--gotta say that I was impressed) and they were delicious. However, they have a dj which is cool but the volume is so high, it's like he thinks he's playing for a club that's 3 times the size packed with people. My friend and I were practically sitting on each other and I couldn't hear a thing she said. If they would just turn down the volume so it didn't make my eardrums violently vibrate, the rating would be much higher. Also, the people in there were not our crowd at all. The people there were super trashy and the waitstaff were rude and tended to disappear. Our waiter was more interested in getting some girl drunk and flirting rather than wait on our table. The food itself is actually pretty good but this is very much a delivery restaurant only!","melissa d."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",5,"2012-03-05","I've had some pretty great experiences here.   First off, their margaritas are STRONG. They come in all sorts of delicious flavors, like pomegranate and coconut, and they're pretty affordable (they have great happy hour specials).  After three margaritas here, I was literally so tipsy that I almost had trouble getting up.  And no hangovers, which is a plus. Their food is also delicious - it's genuine Mexican food.  Their quesadillas with cotija cheese and veggies are delicious, and they make an awesome burrito.  I've also had their chicken nachos and I literally wanted to lick my plate.   I love the addition of jalapeños in their chicken burritos.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this place over Del Mole.  It does get a little 'fratty' with all of their flat screen TVs and the top 40 hip hop and dance music at night - they can't decide if they want to be a hip hop club or an authentic Mexican restaurant.  Nonetheless, I've had a good time every time I've gone here.  All it takes is one margarita and something off their menu,","kelly r."

"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",4,"2011-05-18","Been there eight times in the course of two years. The restaurant is located near the seven train, near all the other restaurants and small businesses of Sunnyside. The food is average, bordering good. The margaritas and alcohol selection is a little better, pretty strong. They have a lunch menu where for $9-12 (remember tax and tip) you can get a lunch order like from a selection of burritos with a margarita or other alcohol drink. The service is slow and not that great, but that's fine because it's a place you can relax and watch the television they have over the bar. The waiters are not rude but not nice either, depends on which you get, just right, in the middle. You can munch on the free chips and basic salsa while you wait for your food. They have bar and table seating. The decor is nice, dark but lit enough to see well, hip, where LED lights brighten up a wall that looks like a Mayan design. In the summer time doors open for a nice view outside as you eat. The bathroom is clean and tables are wiped. Outside is a bus stop.","Andrew S."
"Arriba Arriba Sunnyside",1,"2011-05-22","Both the food and the scene at this place have gone waaaay down hill.  I now only go here for the occasional drink/happy hour, but refuse to be there after 7pm when it turns into a thug-ridden wanna be hip hop / latin club which is so freaking loud I can hear it almost a block away.  I did come here once for the lunch special in recent months and was completely disgusted.  Not only was the service abhorent (I had to ask the waitress 3 times over a period of 30 minutes to refill a glass of water despite being the ONLY person in the restaurant).  The food was blah and I felt like I had wasted my tme and money.  What should have been a meal that took 30-40 minutes from entry into the restaurant to paying the check took over an hour.  The bathrooms were disgusting, the locks did not work and the entire place smelled of old sweat (from all the dancing going on?) and stale beer.  Gross!   I do not appreciate the crowd they're trying to draw at night as it has created groups of roving screamers, even moreso than the half dozen Irish pubs along Queens Blvd.  Put it this way, it's the type of place that prohibits caps on men at night, so you can imagine what sort of ruffians they have experienced in that place.  I really don't want to give them my business anymore.  I'm more than happy to spend my money at Chips and De Mole from this point forward.  Hopefully Arriba Arriba will clean up its act or meet its demise.","Linda B."

"Donna",4,"2016-12-16","My stepbrother lives in Brooklyn & is a chef himself so he takes his food seriously. I was in the city for two nights and he wanted to take us out to a tasty but simple dinner. We all liked the idea of tacos and he said he knew just the spot. Donna was created by Leif Young Huckman & features a rum-driven cocktail list & delicious tacos. The atmosphere is cool and dark, loud music being DJed throughout. There are bar seats and tables but it is a small joint and quite intimate. We came on a Saturday night & the place was crazy busy - I was actually surprised my stepbrother was so cool to know all the happening joints. He's a total hipster but I am grateful he knew of some happening spots.  After he talked to a few servers he knew, he managed to get us a sweet spot at the bar where we ordered beers and perused the simple menu. My stepbro wanted to order for us so we let him take reigns. One order of every taco on the menu & nachos. Each order of tacos came with two tacos and we decided we could just all share. There were 5 different types of tacos: 1- Chicken with Chipotle, Guacamole, Pico de Gallo, Crema, Sesame & Cilantro 2- Slow-Roasted Pork with Salsa Verde, Purple Sauerkraut, Pickled Onion, Cotija, Chicharron & Tajin 3- Pan-Seared Basa with Guacamole, Purple Sauerkraut, Pickled Pineapple Salsa, Serrano & Cilantro 4- Roasted Root Veg [Beets, Yams, Carrots] with Guacamole, Pico de Gallo & Cilantro 5- Marinated Shrimp with Garlic, Parsley, Ginger, White Sauerkraut, Pico de Gallo, Lime Mayo, Sesame & Cilantro The tacos were friggen delicious, cannot lie. I'm usually a crunchy taco person but these were authentic, perfect combinations and full of flavor. Surprisingly, the vegetable taco was one of my faves along with the pork. I don't even love seafood and those fish tacos were pretty bomb. The nachos had yellow queso, black beans, guacamole, pico de gallo, pickled onion, crema, cotija & cilantro. I wasn't totally into the queso, it was kind of like the jarred stuff. I was a little surprised by these after eating the tacos. I don't think I'd order them again purely because the tacos were so delicious. They had a HUGE cocktail menu to choose from, a decent beer selection and great food. Service at the bar wasn't bad and we were checked on a few times although we had to ask for more water. Overall we had an excellent time here. The atmosphere was great for allowing us a chill, fun night out on the town. I'll definitely remember this place the next time I'm cruising in Brooklyn.","Brigitte S."

"Donna",3,"2016-10-23","The fish tacos were good.  Nachos were strangely  white trash inspired  which are the best kind but didn't match the vibe of the place. Like, state fair style processed cheese in a totally classy environment.  Drinks were good  but not amazing. Bartender was very  nice and attentive. Overall,  not a bad place by any means, but prices seemed a tad steep for what was delivered. My friend and I both agreed that El cortez has the upper hand.","Tanya D."
"Donna",4,"2016-07-11","I wasn't sure what to expect when I came to Donna for the first time but I was delighted to find a big and beautiful emporium of cocktails and tacos.  Their drink menu dwarves (dwarfs?) their food menu but this is more of a testament to the creative cocktails.  The range of cocktails includes frozen concoctions and cocktails on tap. Their draft Aperol Spritz (aperol, grapefruit, white wine, seltzer) is the quintessential taste of summer. It's always Spritz O'Clock in the summer baby!  Their small but mighty food menu focuses on tacos, sides and a few shareable dips. It also highlights vegetarian options and a note at the bottom says IT'S ALL GLUTEN FREE BABY.  We had chips with queso and salsa - a perfect afternoon snack to split - and our delightful server brought out more chips when we still had more dips. Leaning heavier on dips in the dip to chip ratio is always preferred if the restaurant is willing to bring out more chips without ridiculously upcharging.  Donna you beautiful lady - such a delight for a Sunday Funday afternoon drink and snack. Low key with just a touch of something more special.  I want to come back for their happy hour - $12 for a well cocktail and tacos!!","Deanna A."
"Donna",5,"2016-11-02","I'm not a local, but out of the many cocktail bars I've been to in New York, this one is my favorite. Yes, it's better than PDT. Service is awesome. The menu is incredibly creative as they use emoji-like characters to give you a preview of how the cocktail will taste. We tried two and both not only sounded delicious, but were also well executed. The Blue Suede Shoes is one of the best cocktails I've ever had. It was like a PB&J tiki drink. Holy crap. Perfectly balanced, perfectly nutty (house made peanut orgeat), very unique. My friend had the Paradise Lost, which was pretty much also a tiki drink but made with cognac and sherry. YUM. Highly recommend. And it's in Williamsburg, tons of stuff to do.","Heather T."
"Donna",4,"2016-01-28","Donna NY Brooklyn Williamsburg 6pm Thursday 29th January 2016 Four Stars I walked into a completely empty place but the staff were welcoming. The space was hip: open space, wooden stools, wooden floors, white walls, and dim lighting. The long bar is the definite focal point for the space with a bookcase of interesting rum, tequila, mezcal, whiskey, and other liquors. I used my Whiskey Passport to drink a Medley Brothers Bourbon Old Fashion. It was a half pour of whiskey served in a thin rocks, with three cold draft ice cubes and garnished with both a large orange peel and smaller lemon peel. It was a bit too sweet for my taste.  They had Chicharron (fried pork skins) on the menu but were no longer available. The bartender offered me an empanada instead ... which they were also not serving. Instead, I decided to take advantage of their M-F 5-7 Happy Hour and get half off Chicken Pibil Tacos ($9 regularly). The double corn tortillas were soft. The shredded chicken was for the most part tender and must be housemade because I found a little piece of tendon. The avocado was more like guacamole spread on the bottom. The toppings of crema, pico, and tomatillo made for a decent bite to eat.  The cocktail menu was fun and interesting. It included infographics displaying the style of each of the cocktails. The Frozen cocktail machine was not working so I opted for the milk punch which came a cool Frank Gehry looking glass. It was sweet, not milky, and not that special.  This place has some definite growing pains but overall I really enjoyed myself.","Leonard L."
"Donna",4,"2015-12-01","'Where is this place?!! In the river?' I absolutely love this place.  1. It does not seem to have an overly 'hipster' vibe that has affected much of NYC. I will say this observation may be due to the fact that I was at Donna's on a Monday night (I think there was about 10 people in the place). I'm pretty sure that this place is very busy on Weekend nights.  2. They have a great assortments of cocktails AND FROZEN drinks. The strawberry negroni (11 bucks) is to die for. Unfortunately, that was the only cocktail that I had so I cannot speak to the other drinks ... Yet. I think that I will have to go back a few more times in order to get a full appreciation of the drink menu.  3. The food was oooookkkk. I ordered the pork tacos and they were pretty standard for an 'upscale' place. The tacos did not compare to the drinks at all. Then again ... I typically prefer booze to food.  4. My only complaint is that the place could use a little extra lighting, especially with so many different things on the menu.  5. The service was pretty on point.  6. I cannot wait to go back again.","Kwame S."

Actually, if we're being honest, she's downright beautiful (I can't imagine a more stylish location for first date drinks, if you're in the market).  And happily, Donna's got the personality to match. Every cocktail we've tried on their menu** is interesting, unique, and so very, very tasty. The Mirror Maze, The Riverboat Gambler, The Rest for the Wicked...I'd gladly revisit any of these again, except that because of the high quality, I'm more interested in seeing what the untried options have to offer.  Best of all, because of the location, the price point, and who knows what else, I don't dread coming in even on a Saturday. Many of the tables were reserved, but there was plenty of seating for our small party. I can't speak to the food yet as I have yet to sample Donna's tacos, etc., but that's just another reason to return. _____________ *I'm not saying I'd leave my wife for Donna, but as my pal Sean says, 'Hopefully they'll menage before I reach my garage.' **I love the little icon indicating how it's served.","Peter D."
"Donna",4,"2015-12-14","My partner and I slinked over here after a show at Baby's All Right and cozied up in a corner by the entrance on a sleepy Friday evening (sleepy and Friday admittedly are not typically written together, I'm aware).  There was a specific drink I'd thought would be on the menu, but given my propensity to read old thrillist/eater articles, it's likely that the selections got flipped for the fall/winter season. regardless, i asked the waitstaff for a hot cocktail recommendation and went with a classic toddy. now, you'd think a hot toddy is nothing to write home about, but actually I find the simple cocktails are the ones that are the easiest to really muck up. not so here, thankfully! i thoroughly enjoyed my toddy and the ambience of the space. although they're well known for their drinks, i think it'd actually be more fun to come here for a meal, since that portion of the space felt much more energetic (and also somewhat separated from the bar area).  plus i mean, breakfast tacos are pretty hard to come by in this city, so any place that even entertains the concept is alright in my book.","Vicki L."

"Donna",4,"2015-11-06","I love this spot. I came here on a Friday night to have some drinks to kick off my birthday weekend celebration. The place has a real nice chill vibe. Music's low enough that you can easily hold a conversation with friends. I ordered the Autumn's Edge after trying my friend's drink. I wish I could make this my go to cocktail everywhere I go. It's so good! We ordered some pork and shrimp tacos from the 1/2 happy hour deal. These tacos were awesome! Our serve Olya was awesome. We bonded over talking about our signs, I'm a Scorpio, she a Taurus and both of us Leo rising. A few minutes late, she brought me and my guest complimentary birthday drinks. That was a really sweet touch. The drinks are on the expensive side (frozen drinks start at $11 and regular cocktails at $14).

"Donna",5,"2015-06-13","Donna's that girl you dated, who didn't have her act together, then you see her again and you're like 'Damn girl, where you been?' Donna wasn't my favorite bar in South Willy B, but after she closed down for awhile, some changes were made and I finally went back. I'm glad I gave her another shot.  There were problems. The Mac Book DJ. The overcrowding bar area. The slow service. None of that remains. It's all gone. It's like someone who went from tragic mess young adult, to 'Yo, they got their masters and know how to do things without googling it first.' They have one of the best cocktail menus in Brooklyn. I can't say it enough. Bars need to label their cocktails with not just the ingredients, but also the cup it's served in, type of ice, (up, rocks, crushed), and if it's stirred or shaken. I have the right to know God dammit!  As for the cocktails they have always been amazing. Even when homegirl didn't have everything going on, she always could make a great drink. Just tried the Better Red Than Dead, the other night. Get on that.  My only remaining quarrel is the bathroom. Don't get me wrong. They're beautiful. It has a classic look for the old building that it's in. What's the issue then? The sink. The sink is one you'd find in your grandmother's apartment. There's a cold faucet and a scolding lava faucet, that bring out two different streams of water/lava from two different pipes. Even if you turn the scolding lava faucet a millimeter, it's still scolding hot lava. Don't touch it. Don't ever touch it. Be careful, she will burn you.  In the end, you should give Donna a first or second chance. But I'm telling you Donna, I don't give third chance. Don't mess up!","Mitch E."
"Donna",5,"2016-10-16","We hosted our wedding reception here and could not be happier with how everything turned out. Maya and the rest of the staff (Olya is so sweet!) were incredibly kind and super helpful. They organized a DJ for us, helped us to craft a custom punch (Maya even handmade a little sign for it), and put our donuts on large plates that were brought out towards the end at no extra charge. They were also super chill with us bringing in a few decorations like flowers. Plus, the cocktails were delicious, and the tacos served were super yummy too!  Thank you Maya, Leif and everyone else for making our reception so wonderful! We will be back for drinks soon! Hannah & Conor","Hannah F."
"Donna",4,"2016-02-20","Swagger.  Here we are having frozen dranks.  Jake and half of the crew are in California doing some mega jump.  Just got a load of nachos to cope with the stress of having a homey fly 3000 miles away.  Dranks go.  Chips don't go so hard.  They may be out of a bag but so what.  Askeddit","Kevin G."
"Donna",5,"2016-03-15","These people really care about what their pouring. Great service.Their cocktail menu is great and very animated ( great little symbols).. The atmosphere is great. My girlfriend said she felt like she was back in Barcelona. I thought it was well executed down to the glassware. Had the milk punch on draft and the vice frozen cocktail(mix of strawberry negroni and mentha branca pina colada) and both I would order again and again. My girlfriend loved the autumn drink, but for me it was just standard very good. Tacos were very good. You can't beat their taco happy hour!","Jarret E."
"Donna",4,"2015-12-02","Overall, a very positive experience, would definitely come back.  - great cocktails - especially the Milk Punch - The pork tacos are tasty - The shrimp ones were also good, but a little watery - Great guac - Friendly service - Nice interior","K B."
"Donna",5,"2015-01-28","This place is awesome. I stopped in while working on an article about hot cocktail spots in South Williamsburg and fell in love. This place is beautiful! Low light, gorgeous big bar, and tall cathedral ceilings.. gorg! The service was fantastic as well. I was really impressed with how helpful everyone was! The bartender was more than happy to tell me all about their most popular drinks. The Brancolada should be world renowned... no really it should. The texture was ON POINT. Not icey but frozen... soft and creamy but not sickly sweet... damn that is a good cocktail! A DJ is always up playing great 'loungey' music but it was never overpowering, just great ambiance.  On my last visit I had some of the tacos they offer - I was very impressed. The pork taco was delicious and my Mexican corn in a cup... to DIE. See ya this weekend Donna ;)","Jess D."
"Donna",5,"2016-03-22","I love places like this. I was packed when we went and somewhat hard to get a seat, but it's okay. Staff was stressed, to the point where they were responding a bit snappy. Great place, despite that stuff. But they should consider an extra person working the weekends.","Andrea Z."
"Donna",5,"2016-06-15","I'm definitely coming back to Donna. I came here to kill time while I waited for a friend's grad party. I very much enjoyed the diverse and interesting cocktail menu. I had the Wander With Me and operation Bootstrap punch. Both were amazing. The staff were very pleasant.","Marlon M."
"Donna",4,"2015-05-16","I have mixed feelings about Donna. We came as a part of the LOADed Cocktail passports. It was a great bar - dim lighting, fancy bar, nice decor and layout, sort of a Puerto Rican feel. We also ended up getting some pretty good drinks (not as good as Randolph Brooklyn but pretty close second)! The only downside is the loud music and how crowded it gets. It's going to be hard to get a seat and whenever you walk around, you will inevitably have to wade through all of the people!","Judy S."
"Donna",2,"2016-11-06","I'm only giving 2 stars because 1) the food and 2) the drinks. Once we got there the manager forgot my friends birthday dinner reservation and so the manager came to 'clear the air'.. so we thought.. instead made the whole experience completely worse! I can't believe she is managing this place. The bartenders were awesome, once we realized we should go through them! Anyway, do not plan big events because they are clearly annoyed from the minute you walk in!","Taylor G."
"Donna",2,"2016-04-09","Please update your menus!! You apparently have not served brunch in 6 months but it was advertised on your menu a couple of weeks ago, so we walked in the cold rain from the M train all excited about your supposed 'unlimited brunch.'","Jared K."
"Donna",5,"2016-06-29","Have only had the drinks but they are amazing. They Milano Vice is the greatest frozen cocktail of all time. Very outgoing and kind staff. Table service. Great spot in BillyBurg!","Davis R."
"Donna",2,"2016-05-12","I'm really not the type of person to return a drink, but this was truly horrible. The strawberry smoothie happy hour cocktail was just un-drinkable. Server took it away but charged us for it. No.","Elena F."
"Donna",5,"2014-06-16","Psssst...it's under the radar, but Donna is unofficially in it's soft open! You wouldn't know anything changed, minus a different drink menu and some new bartender faces.  It literally opened it's doors last week, but in the words of Selena Gomez (shoot me): if you're ready come and get it. I'll see ya there.","Amanda S."

"Donna",5,"2016-01-05","All the good food and cocktails, none of the pretentious attitude-everyone here is friendly and knowledgable, I really appreciate the bartenders and waiters patient enough to explain their extensive cocktail menu. Love the grown up frozen drinks. Very chill crowd too, no amateurs or douchebags (but that may just be because I go on weeknights). The DJ and specials on Taco Tuesday are great (and doesn't get too crowded).  Another nice touch is the candles in the bathroom locally made by a small biz in Brooklyn. I usually hate new places since they seem to lack any character, but Donna is great and I'm happy they're back.","Divya A."
"Donna",4,"2015-05-08","Went for the first time on Cinco de Mayo so was busy as can be expected. Really good atmosphere with a DJ playing music at just the right level.  The tacos were really tasty and fresh and there's a good selection of fillings.  Only sampled some margaritas from the cocktail menu but they were damn good.","David I."
"Donna",5,"2016-01-06","Love the drinks, love the vibe, love the music....my go-to in this area, preferably before dancing my butt off at Bembe.","Anita Y."
"Donna",3,"2013-02-17","Gorgeous new bar that's not there yet.   It's a shame to see such a divine space wasted by making the music an afterthought -- just someone's iPod plugged in pumping out the most cliche Brooklyn-contempo soundtrack that one can conjure up. It's also downright offensive in the face of a cocktail as beautiful and cared for as the Haunted House.  Additionally, the place seems short-handed. Our poor waitress ran among seven or eight tables, all of which were filled with people expecting the greatness that comes along with a bar that this one is trying to be. Good happy hour. Great drinks. Nice space. Just needs the right team to pay attention to the details. They'll hopefully get there -- it's new.","Malcolm K."
"Donna",4,"2015-08-31","Do not go here during happy hour unless you can handle the crowd. The crowd is a bunch of white-collar 30-something dudes that do not move...ever. They magically disappear as soon as happy hour is over and you can breathe again. The cocktails are fruity and delectable and the tacos are savory but can get messy. I had the fish and steak tacos and they are pretty awesome and decently sized. I couldn't finish the 4th taco. Pretty great spot aside from happy hour..hours.","Jeanne C."
"Donna",4,"2015-09-19","Nice grown and sexy spot for a date night.  Good food great drinks.  The music was not for me but I have nothing bad to say about this place.  Check it out.","Michael N."
"Donna",2,"2015-03-01","Inefficient layout leads to a crowded bar where you are presented with a menu full of mediocre cocktails. The bartender will make you a surprisingly bad version of your favorite drink and you will be disappointed. The pretentious clientele will most likely push and shove you out of the way forcing you to spill your drink on yourself. If you're lucky, the owner might yell at you as well.  You will be disappointed. Go somewhere else.","Young J."
"Donna",4,"2014-10-04","Donna looks like an old church on a caribbean island that has been converted into a cocktail bar. Vaulted ceilings, dim lighting, just the right amount of dark wood, white paint, and wrought iron fixtures. I love their tropical cocktails, especially anything that comes with an umbrella.  Donna also has a walk-up coffee and taco window in the front, perfect for weekends or a late night snack.","Erica J."
"Donna",5,"2015-05-26","I had my birthday party at Donna and they were incredibly accommodating and wonderful. The drinks are superb and it's just a good vibe. good music! I also had Sarah O (who works in the kitchen) make my birthday cupcakes that were outrageously good, she made them black on black. so chic!","Jennifer F."
"Donna",4,"2014-09-10","Like a lighthouse in a storm, Donna stands out. I didn't make it before they shut down due to the fire, but I finally got to see what the fuss was about. I dragged a friend here the last time I was in the area, and we sat at the bar and ordered frozen brancoladas (a fun take on the pina colada, $10) and pretended we were in a swanky bar on some island in the 1920's. The bar was full of pretty people, and it was hard at first to find a seat--this was around 10-11 on a Saturday night. It started to thin out after 12, but the DJ was going strong playing soul and funk music. We ended up departing to another not as swanky bar to meet friends, but the seed has been planted. I could see Donna as a place to good with a group, or with a date. Until then, I'll be day dreaming.","Chey H."
"Donna",5,"2015-11-07","Stopped in during the day to knit and drink with my husband. Great creative cocktail menu. Creative flavors with a fun atmosphere. Really enjoyed it and will be back in the future. Chips and guacamole were nice too!","Alison M."
"Donna",1,"2016-02-15","Went here on a weekday and it wasnt really crowded, we were greeted and sat down, i wanted to like this place but the service was pretty bad! There drink menu was a bit confusing, a drink that ordered with mezcal came out looking completely different than what I expected and it was not balanced, The food menu was small, we ate the tacos and a rice bowl, it was not good, i wouldnt definitely not order food here again, maybe there only really busy because they have a bottomless brunch, but its def not worth it as the staff was unfriendly, cold, and un helpful! Did not feel comfortable and cozy like the place seems it could be, but the management clearly has no idea how to run a sufficient team! Disappointed","Jessica D."
"Donna",5,"2013-05-19","Donna officially knocks off Park Bar as my favorite bar/lounge to go out to when I trek into the City. I can't say enough good things about this place. Everything from the creativity of the drinks, to the professionalism of the mixologists -- this place just fires on all pistons. And it's beautiful inside. I want to live here. My friends know the owners, so we always get white glove treatment. And as long as you're not a moron, you will too.","Christopher K."

"Donna",4,"2015-06-02","Really well done space. Gorgeous build out, great cocktails, always solid music/DJ. Although the stand-out for me were the tacos. They're the main reason I keep going back. Incredible. Great spot to grab a late night cocktail (or 3) and some small bites.","Jon S."
"Donna",4,"2012-09-24","S and I like to have cocktail bar hopping dates. In this part of the 'burg, as good as they are, how can you stay at one place where there are two dozen calling your name? Donna did not disappoint. I loved my tequila cocktail, with rhubarb bitters so much, I had another. Danger. Smarmy insists their bar food is good, too. And what did I tell you about disagreeing with Melga Smarmy? Exactly. Nice lighting and interesting layout, with the white tile and little back patio area. The scene was what you'd expect, if a liiiiitle more grown ups and less unwashed children, on a recent Saturday night.","Claire F."
"Donna",5,"2015-02-28","Stopped by this morning for brunch. We opted for the prix-fixe with food, coffee, and a really good bloody. Very reasonably priced for a very well made cocktail, and large portion of food. The bottomless cup of coffee was awesome.  The staff could not have been nicer. The space is beautiful, and we had it largely to ourselves as we arrived right when they opened. Can't wait to go back.","Tom B."
"Donna",3,"2015-02-20","Came here for happy hour one evening. We really like the space and the staff was friendly and accommodating, even asking if we needed the heat turned up or down. The only downside was they did not have the cocktail my girlfriend initially wanted, but we had the chipotle chicken tacos along with esquite, which completely made up for not having the cocktail.","Steve G."
"Donna",5,"2012-05-09","I still don't think Williamsburg's cocktail scene is at the saturation point (ever try to get into Maison on a Saturday night?), but even if there was a speakeasy on every block I'd still be thrilled to have newcomer Donna in the neighborhood.  It's a unique and charming space featuring vaulted ceilings, thoughtful detailing, and pitch-perfect lighting level. I'm struggling to find a criticism for the drinks. Lo and behold, it's still possible to get a cocktail for $10 in Brooklyn. The on-menu ones I had were bold, intense, and adventurous yet expertly balanced. There is a heavy rum focus but the options are diverse in profile and presentation. I wasn't there during a particularly busy time but the staff was welcoming and remarkably well-organized for a new spot.  Critiques: the menu is illegible. I like the DIY aesthetic and the crazed hand-drawn font but it wasn't easy even for me to read under the lighting. For the farsighted or those who have wrecked their eyesight staring at laptops, it may as well be written in Cyrillic. I imagine most people will find the food overpriced. They're not meant to be entrees but picture the polar opposite of Denny's Grand Slam. But I don't really care about the food...a good cocktail bar that is possible to get into on a weekend is all I need and Donna seems to fit the bill.","Adam C."
"Donna",5,"2015-08-11","Great bar in Williamsburg. I love their tacos here, big servings, very fresh and flavorsome. The nachos are great too. They change their menu reasonably frequently, which is a nice touch.","Luke V."
"Donna",2,"2015-02-28","Drinks at Donna are great but our bartender was not.  A very abrupt customers leaned into me while I had a seat at the bar--she apparently was very thirsty and almost pushed me out of my chair.  I only survived by balancing on the one peg of my bar stool. The bartender then scolded me for holding my ground.  I left feeling diminished and confused.  Across the street, at Baby's, there's more room at the bar, and zero attitude from any of the great staff.","V P."

"Donna",4,"2013-08-18","Donna and I crossed paths at the Elite Kickoff for the All Starr Challenge. Lime, cinnamon, and ginger all in one glass? It was love at first sip .  Let's first acknowledge the obvious: when it comes to the name, there may be some biases here. Sure it's misspelled, and yeah I'm sick of the typo, but it still SOUNDS like my name.. So yep, I'm a fan. My first time there wasn't the busiest of nights, and we were able to score a couple tables in the back. Great lighting-- I mean, that may sound like strange, but the perfect balance between bright and dim is pivotal in establishing a particular ambiance.. and this place has got it on lock.  Friends, beer, and shots were all present, so we were having a good time. But what really kicked it up was the False Start. Rum, sherry, lime, ginger, and cinnamon. So tasty that I drank I in fractional sips to make the flavor last.  Bartenders were nice, decor was snazzy, plus that little Donna (Dahna) charm leaves a girl feeling great.","Dahna S."
"Donna",1,"2014-10-21","Oh, Donna. Sadly, you've come to represent the pernicious scene Williamsburg has become. Went to enjoy a fancy cocktail on a mellow Saturday night around 8 pm. The counter was spoken for so helped myself to a table. Noticed the placard indicating the 11 reservation. Flustered hostess/waitress dropped by and reiterated placard info. Sure. I'm only here for one and don't drink at a glacial pace. She then asked me to move to another table. Sure. She moves me to another table with same placard, reserved at 11. Another waitress approached and yes, pointed out that this table was needed at 11. This welcoming committee could charm the paint off the very walls. With that generous opening, I bid them good night.","Hellan D."
"Donna",5,"2014-08-15","Unfortunately, I haven't been to the bar yet, but wanted to recommend these guys for their catering service. They catered our wedding (9/1/13) on fairly last minute notice and for a great price (75 people for under $2,000 if memory serves).  They were a real pleasure to work with--responding immediately, running the numbers quickly, being on top of the licensing paperwork. And frankly, for the peace of mind they gave us in getting our wedding planning on the right track, I would have gladly paid more.  A real godsend.  On the day of, they were on time, ran a very professional operation (while being a lot of fun), and graciously worked with our venue (a rooftop farm) and its challenges.  And their partner, Brooklyn Taco, blew everyone away with their scrumptious food and gave us a very memorable night.  Definitely give Leif a call for your alcohol-catering needs--you'll be glad you did!","Guy L."
"Donna",3,"2012-04-21","Donna walks the line between local dive and classy lounge. The interior is pretty cool in that it's hard to tell what is original, and what is new construction. The place has been open to the public less than a week so I won't comment on service - especially since they haven't begun (bar) food service. Location is a bit.... out there, but I have a friends who live nearby so I look forward to seeing how this place does. In closing - I would like to apologize for folding our menu into a paper airplane - It was kind of a dick move, but it just felt so right at the time.","Alan L."
"Donna",3,"2014-08-20","Stopped by at midnight on a Sunday-very suave sexy décor- throwback in time. expensive mixology drinks available. nice service- also an underground feel, but very modern at the same time- this place has its interior design to a point! may go back to try the food one day. Didn't stay long- but if im in the area- I will try it again.","Julia M."
"Donna",3,"2014-11-29","Would have put 4 stars if the guys can decide if they want people to talk or to dance. Music is as loud as in a club but there is no way to dance vs. The space. So you are left trying to talk to your friends without destroying their ears. Otherwise place is greatly decorated, cocktails are very good and the crowd is cool.","Marine G."
"Donna",5,"2013-08-28","Donna is a nice place to chill, have a few drinks and chat with friends.  I've had a few of the specialty cocktails & they have all been delicious.  The bar isn't too quiet or too loud.  The bartenders are among the nicest I've ever encountered.   I would add an extra star for Brooklyn Taco Co. if I could.  Brooklyn Taco Co. tacos are my favorite in the city. The brisket taco + a yummy cocktail with cute surroundings & nice people = happy & chill time. This review is only for weekdays.  I went on a weekend & I waited over 12 minutes to get a drink & left because I didn't see it happening any time soon.","Jennie A."

Serious about the view, too.","Katie M."
"Donna",4,"2013-03-21","When the lady and I are feeling boozy on a Friday night, we like to search the city for the perfect cocktail. Last Friday, after a week of toil and strife that would make the crew of the Galactica call in sick we decided to set our sights on Williamsburg. Now, the 'Burg is an oft lamented neighborhood. Before it became the epicenter of bartenders with the beards of homeless woodsmen and the subject of crappy television it was the epicenter of wild turkey shots, struggling musicians and aging drunks. The current incarnation is neither an improvement nor a decline. If there is one thing you can say for self-important hipsters, it's that they're environmentally productive. Hipsters bring quality restaurants, fresh groceries, art, small businesses and excellent bars as side effects to their terminal affliction of general shittery. They may be smarmy little bastards, but I'll take them over, say, junky punk rockers any day. So, it is with a mix of appreciation and mild contempt that I say the Donna is a wonderful place for hipsters and quality cocktails. I'd say that they over use their aromatics and it at times makes their drinks more pungent than I'd like. It may smell nice when you hand it off to the waitress, but drinking what can feel like a glass of Elderflower berry isn't the most pleasant experience.  This complaint was most prevalent in their whiskey based cocktails. However, their tequila based drinks were nicely balanced with a generous pour. Loved it! The vibe is nauseatingly hispter. Be prepared to be slightly annoyed, but remember that it's all in fun. And let's be honest: we'd all rather sit next to a snotty hipster than an aging drunk.","Alex I."
"Donna",4,"2014-07-05","Atmosphere here is very cool--feels like a trendy, off-the-beaten-path Cuban lounge. Cocktail list is extensive and covers a wide array of house-specialty drinks; they arrange their concoctions from least complex to most, charging the same $12 for all of them. Would definitely come back for more drinks and try to catch the happy hour.","Ben K."
"Donna",4,"2013-07-11","Beautiful space and a nice price for the quality of delicious cocktails! The space feels open and airy even with all of the windows closed.  They serve tacos that are yum-tastic. The bartender was crafting fabulous drinks and was super friendly.   It was really nice to grab a drink with a friend, but it didn't feel as comfortable once it started getting packed.  I will continue to start my nights there! :)","Jessica J."
"Donna",5,"2013-09-06","Rarely do the most hyped spots live up to their expectations, but Donna is an exception. From the awesome space, to the variety, to the quality of the drinks, and, oh yeah!, Brooklyn Taco, Donna is probably the best bar in Williamsburg.  I've been on first dates here, meetings, and its a great spot for finishing a night out with friends.  Why so great? Fancy cocktails, and cheap beers Brooklyn Taco Super friendly bartenders","Grayum V."
"Donna",4,"2012-11-24","This place is kind of strange in its normalcy, if that makes sense. 1) It's all the way out on Broadway by Kent, so in a way it's kind of in buttfuck nowhere. 2) It has a beautiful curvy interior that's very luscious and 3) has this very upscale clientele vibe that other places in the area give off (Diner/Dressler/etc) & makes me feel like everyone works in publishing or the Chelsea gallery scene & just got done with their fancy meals nearby... Trying to combine all these thoughts w/ South Williamsburg makes it kind of off, but also kind of work. I'm not sure if they normally have table service (?) but luckily it wasn't that busy and we were attended to right away at the bar. I had a really nicely made bourbon cocktail ($10) & was able to hide away at a back table with some friends. The DJ was spinning some kind of funky music (like, literal funk) and it wasn't really working but it was mainly background music anyway so I didn't mind. All in all, a nice date spot, more of a 'grown-up' spot, and despite all this, fairly unpretentious. I sort of feel like on another night I would have been disappointed because this Manhattany opulence isn't really my (or the area's) thing, but a good cocktail combined with a piquant ambiance and plenty of table seating left me with good vibes & a desire to come back. A very generous four stars.","Nemo L."
"Donna",4,"2013-06-05","I had my birthday party here last week and this bar is SO beautiful. It's not a huge bar, but they nailed the aesthetic.  Lots of seating and had no trouble finding street parking across the way.  There was never a wait for the bathrooms and the drinks they serve were complex, but full of flavor and adequately priced. I felt very classy drinking and hanging out here.  You can still pay $15 for a drink in Williamsburg and drink next to douchebags so it was nice to find a place where I didn't have to worry about that.","Carmel U."
"Donna",4,"2012-05-21","I like Rum. A lot. I like Latin food. A lot. So seeing as Donna's menu leans heavily on both counts, you can rest assured this place had a leg up with me from the get go. Also, what a gorgeous bar! Open late, serves food late. Plenty of room as well, but it's a small hike to get to unless you happen to live nearby.  As others have said, the menu is kind of hard to read, and doubly so due to the super low lighting. They really need to rethink how they lay out the food portion, it's comically ridiculous. Also, while the food was tasty, some of the dishes could be a better value.  Love the cocktail list. Cocktails are in the 10-12 range, which is right in line with the better bars in Williamsburg. 90% of the drinks are Latin focused, either based on Rum, Tequila/Mezcal or Pisco. They do have a few others to round things out, and the bartenders are happy to do requests should you want something different. Tried and enjoyed the Haunted House and Watership Down, but left wishing I had more time (and moxie) to try about 5 of the other menu drinks.  Will return when in the area for sure.

"Donna",4,"2012-12-28","I've had some good times at Donna.  One of their specialty cocktails, the Watership Down, is delicious and inventive.  Either that, or I love any drink with a celery stalk in it.  Imbibing in a healthy way!  Sure, I'll take another - double up on my health. (Side note - I once heard someone describe a certain type of Saki as being 'lightly gorgeous'.  The WD is also lightly gorgeous. Interpret that how you will.) In my squandered youth, I visited the island of Ios in Greece.  This place was filled with rioting euro-dogs slamming ouzo, putting in their best effort to get laid.  The beauty of the island - white limestone against turquoise water - seemingly evaded them.  One evening, I came across a 'heavily gorgeous' bar composed entirely of this same gleaming white stone.  I was mesmerized.  I stayed there all night, propped up with ouzo in hand and friends within shouting distance.  What does this have to do with Donna?  Well Donna kinda looks like that place - sans euro-dogs.  Unless you include the fuzzy french foreigners, Air-BnB'ing their way around the southside.   Definitely worth a visit.","Tim M."
"Donna",4,"2012-05-26","I like this place. I've been there three times since it opened a few weeks ago and I'll be back again. They have some pretty impressive cocktails. In particular, the Watership Down and Haunted House are my favs! The Brancolada, a woman's drink, is what my ladies  friends ordered each time.  I tried the Morgan Town too, but it wasn't that good, something about mixing bourbon with coke just doesn't sit well with my tastes... Although the cocktails are great, they're not quite on the same level as Hotel Del Mano or Water Foods. However, they're well worth a try. The place is brand new though, so let' give it some time. On to the food... The tapas are effin amazing. I mean, I was eating pig face terrine, heart and tongue and I was loving it... asking for seconds and what not! I'm not usually the type to eat such exotic/weird foods such as organ meats and the like, but after a few of those delicious cocktails, I was down for anything.  I suggest the empanada as well... they do it just right. The maduros are great too... they serve them with salsa verde and a little shaved sea salt which, on the surface, would seem to be a cultural faux pas, but works so damn well!  And don't get me started on maduros either, bro. I know all about maduros, ok... my girlfriend is Dominican, the maduro masters of the universe, so you just can't get subpar maduros past me.  To add a little more balance to my review, Donna really needs to be better staffed. We had to wait longer than usual for our food, drinks and service. Also, they need to fill the cocktail glasses up to the rim like everyone else... this 3/4 full glass nonsense is not cool. And why you're at it, get rid of the $10 tomato too, that's just going to piss a lot of people off... a tomato should only be $9, of course! On a final note, I went with a  couple foodie friends and a good time and good meal was had by all. We'll definitely be back!","Dezzy F."
"Donna",4,"2013-02-18","Really really really good cocktails. Cute interior and friendly staff. In the beginning this place was a hidden gem. We could come here at any time and get a table. Lately more people have found out about this place, so much that it is hard to find a seat on Friday and Saturday night. Come early in the weekends, and for gods sake order that smoky peach drink.","Morten H."
"Donna",3,"2013-04-14","Let's start with the cocktails--delicious and reasonably priced. By 10:30 or so on a Saturday night the place was packed but in a pleasant rather than rambunctious way. Service was a little hard to flag down, but not impossible and the atmosphere fit in very well with the williamsberg loft vibe--all white walls with splashes of colorful art and soft white lighting.  I liked that the place was filled to the brim but still had an air of sophistication. Points were also scored for me when they started playing a fleetwood mac remix of all things.I didn't stay long because I came for post dinner-date drinks and there was barely space to breath let alone talk, but I'd definitely stop by again if I could get there a little earlier to beat the crowds.","Charlotte C."
"Donna",3,"2013-03-13","This is a really cool space in ultra-hip Williamsburg.  I am pretty sure the entire cast of girls was sitting at the bar. Great cocktails and wine selection.  Reasonably priced, and they allow you to order pizza in.  I went for a friends birthday and the bar said her party could bring in records and spin our own music until their regular DJ's came.  Gotta say, the music we provided was much better than the regulars...but I think everyone in Williamsburg is a DJ so there is undoubtably going to be some disagreement. If I'm ever in the area, I will go back here.","Aashiq T."
"Donna",2,"2012-04-19","Decor was great and tastefully done. Service on the other hand was terrible. Bartender chatted with her friends for about 15 minutes before handing me a menu. Took another 10 minutes or so before coming back and taking my order. When I suggested a twist on listed cocktail she made it clear that no substitutions possible. The place has a good vibe, too bad the service is lame.","daniel g."
"Donna",3,"2012-09-10","How very Manhattan of them. To quote a friend, 'A few years back, I was running away from people coming at me with knives from the train. Now there's this bar.' :) I'm sure I'll be back - not too pretentious, but also more upscale than my typical neighborhood hangout.","Niki C."
"Donna",4,"2012-07-23","enjoyed this place. They have a wonderful brunch $18 on weekends: -2 poached eggs in olive oil -papas bravas -tortillas or toast -1 sides (marinated tomatoes, pork belly, or such) -1 cocktail and coffee/tea Yes!! and yum. such a great deal. we were happy and the atmosphere reminded me of south of spain. the watermelon cooler was amazing too. a def- plus for the area.","D O."
"Donna",5,"2012-12-12","I've lived in Williamsburg for seven years and have been waiting for a place like Donna to open. Amazing drinks and great atmosphere all show cased in the most beautiful interior space I've ever seen. Every time go, regardless of stopping by on a week day or weekend . . . for big party or a romantic date, Donna always delivers the perfect evening. I couldn't imagine a better addition to the neighborhood. My suggestion is to try either the Smokey Peach or the Artichoke Hold. Two truly unique drinks -- the only bar in town where I'll opt for the cocktails over beer or wine. A+","Porter H."
"Donna",3,"2012-08-07","A really nice space and though it's only 12 blocks away from home, wish it were a bit closer so I could call it my local. On the Saturday night we were there, they had a DJ spinning a strange mix of 80s, 80s revival and some remixed new wave. Really helpful waitress and some fairly decent libations.","Stephen Y."
"Donna",1,"2014-10-04","This place is pretentious and rude. Ignored us until 2 minutes after happy hour then wouldn't serve us the special. Then they were out of just about anything good on the menu. Save your frustration and money and go down the street to OTB.","Rachelle R."
"Donna",4,"2012-06-08","I like this place.  I haven't tried the food, but the cocktails are fantastic, particularly the smokey peach.  And they offer some fine, inexpensive beers so you don't have to stop drinking after you realize you've spent a lot of money on cocktails and want to reel it in a bit.  I've been there twice and had great service both times.    My only complaint is with the acoustics.  It seems that even if the music isn't very loud, it's hard to hear someone who is more than a foot away from you unless they are yelling.  I would also agree with others that the typography of the menu might not be a good fit for the lighting at hand. It looks great, and it is kind of fun to see whether people twist their necks to read it or turn the menu a quarter-turn, but it needs work.","C T."
"Donna",2,"2012-12-09","What a bust. Went here for my friend's birthday on a Saturday night and the drinks were solid but everything else was a massive letdown. Our table was being waited on but I felt like I had to wave wildly to ever put in an order with the waitress, even when she was attending the table, and always made to feel like I was somehow interrupting or asking her to do something that wasn't in her job description. At the end of the night we were charged a 20% gratuity which at a $10+ cocktail place is decidedly not fair. One does not tip $2 on every single cocktail. We also selected the bar because a friend in the neighborhood asked earlier in the week if there was dancing. The bartender was so enthusiastic she insisted that sometimes they even *dance on the tables*. Ha! The sound system was terrible, just two glorified lap top speakers, and the DJ worse. He wouldn't accommodate any requests and all his decisions seemed specifically geared to getting us to go away. He insisted the low volume was due to neighbors complaints but it wasn't even loud enough to hear over people talking. A woman we suspected was managerial kept lording over the proceedings and when we finally gave up and went back to our table, she came out to dance her tail off and suddenly the music went up. I don't even know how to explain these events that transpired. We were hardly being loud, rude, or obnoxious, just in the festive spirit for my friend's birthday, and we came bearing 12+ customers who ordered multiple rounds. Even her mom came out to have a good time. Thanks for making us feel decidedly not at home Donna. Won't be back!","Brynn W."
"Donna",1,"2012-08-28","Another 'too cool to serve you' bartender scene? No thx. Place looks great and I haven't tried the food but service is #1 to me, as I am a server and have lived and served here (WB) for 10 yrs. silly girl, you wouldn't have a job if it weren't for trailblazers like us. I'll spend my $$$$ elsewhere, as in Lucky Dog where they know how to treat people.","Sarah R."
"Donna",5,"2013-05-12","A beautifully designed space. Part of the experience is just sitting there and admiring the clean, white design. I like that there is no table service. That way, you can order drinks at your own pace and tip as you go (depending on how much you like your drink and the service that you receive). The candle-lit lighting is fantastic (i.e. perfect date spot) and the location is ideal if you're looking to avoid the hustle and bustle of the often annoying Burg on a Friday night. The place is tucked under the bridge and is one of few good cocktail spots in the area. It still gets packed but not in a way that is uncomfortable. Donna means 'lady' in Italian. I like it!","Marta J."
"Donna",4,"2013-04-23","My girlfriend and I went here for girls night last Saturday and it was a great experience. The bar tenders were so sweet and kept our drinks filled all night-- super attentive. We had tacos from the taco cart and it was delicious. Will be going back once I move to NYC and cant wait!","Emma G."
"Donna",5,"2013-02-12","Top notch cocktails and an incredibly beautiful old-timey ambience. Similar to Maison Premiere, although more seating and better music.","nicole b."
"Donna",4,"2013-01-23","Great space. Very spacious. Nice creative original cocktails. Not too crowded -- but a sizable crowd. Drinks take a while to make, so if you're pressed for time this is not your watering hole tonight.  Otherwise... it's a wonderful cocktail bar. Our server was hilarious.  Couldn't tell if he was serious, snarky, or silly. Kept us on our toes. A great time was had by all!","Jason O."
"Donna",4,"2012-12-01","Great drinks and amazing atmosphere. Packed on a Friday night.","Stephen W."
"Donna",4,"2013-04-19","Donna is great.  It gets 4 stars because it is SO loud and I fu*ked up my voice there on a Sat night just trying to have conversation.  But I LOVE the cocktails.  And the design is beautiful.  I read some service complaints but I've only had good service.  Sure, the cocktails take a minute to make.  But they're specialty cocktails.  I'm into the cocktail scene and I know what goes into making proper drinks.  I'll happily wait a minute for top notch cocktails.  I think I'll try to stick going during times that it's not crazy crazy busy.  I also love how anyone can go, and yet it's still a scene to be seen.","Gemma L."

"Donna",4,"2012-04-22","I really like Donna.  The environment is nice and fun, the drinks are good, what else do you need?  I expected a little haphazard service because the place just opened but it was completely on point.  I will be back.  Probably more than I should.","Vicki L."

"Donna",5,"2012-07-12","Accidentally ran into this place on the way to a wedding at giando's a block away, with an old friend. Loved it so much that after the wedding we ended back here.  This is an awesome bar with loads of character -- in no way a typical cocktail lounge. Can't speak to the food (didn't have any), but the drinks were flowing all night, and they were spectacular and quite unique. I really didn't want to leave this place by the end of the night (or rather morning) -- behind the bar we had Selma helping us explore many of  the awesome concoctions on the menu, plus a few of her own creation. You gotta love a place that is willing to throw anyone out the door that orders a flavored vodka drink or anything with redbull. If these are your drinks, stay away. They also have a few stellar beers on tap. Don't miss out on this place!","Christian C."
"Donna",5,"2013-02-23","class act across the board.. these folks have made a great contribution to night life culture.. tunes, vibe, booze, chicks,  and a clean shitter... what else is there under a bridge? show up, dont act like a terd and have fun.. xo","ryan v."
"Donna",4,"2012-04-23","Finally, a great place without the attitude. Or a scene. Great drinks. Great look. And just out of the way enough that the locals may have a month or two before the place is packed with northsiders trying to be cool.","R J."
"Donna",1,"2013-06-16","I had brunch with friends today at Donna.  While I found the place lively and upbeat, I was extremely disappointed with the bland food and especially with the substandard service.  One of our waitresses even insulted us when my friend politely asked her how one says 'Cheers' in French.  She snapped back and replied 'Merde'!    One doesn't need to speak French fluently to know that this word means something totally different.  This was my first and definitely my last time as I will not be going back.","Von R."
"Donna",2,"2012-12-09","Donna, you let me down! I've come here a number of times during the week - always  pleasant, the drinks solid, interior lush and well appointed. So when my friend suggested I celebrate my birthday here particularly because a staff member claimed the music gets so good on the weekend 'people dance on the bar' I dared to dream that perhaps you would prove to be a buttoned up cousin of dearly departed Passerby.  Not a fucking chance. The polite but clueless DJ played such a lackluster set and at an infuriatingly low volume it could've been the waiting room of a 'cool' doctor's office. DJ claimed he wasn't allowed to turn up volume (even though so low at times you couldn't make out lyrics) because noise complaints and seemed determined to stick to the most vanilla of tracks possible - inoffensive but tedious. While dancing we got looks from some bored looking girls hovering over the tiny space we occupied. Didn't think much of it until I realized one of the ladies was on staff and when we finally gave up and sat back down with the rest of our group suddenly the volume was up, music marginally more exciting and the stink-eyed three in our former spot dancing. When we went back to join, the other ladies fled. What gives? Never heard of dancing next to strangers? We're a group of sensible, sexy 30 somethings just trying to have some fun. Whatever was going on it was very silly and lame reminiscent of 'crashing' an insecure high schooler's party even though we brought in a nice chunk of cash with our bibulous table of 12. Our waitress was kick ass though, fast and kind.","Saul T."
"Donna",5,"2012-06-12","sexy and beautiful.  great small plates and very nice cocktail and wine selection.  it's one of the few places in the city that truly feels like you're in a different time and place.  well done.","Will P."
"Donna",5,"2012-04-20","What a place! One of the best bars in S.Willismsburg. Total local favorite. Top shelf whiskey as well as PBR. Why didn't someone else think of this earlier. Haha, #BkGOLD.","John F."
"Donna",4,"2012-08-06","We live right by Donna and have wanted to check it out ever since it opened. The atmosphere is really cool inside - they really did a nice job setting the place up. We went for brunch on a Saturday right when they opened so we had the entire place to ourselves. It was amazing to not have to wait at all to be seated. So needless to say the service was excellent since we were the only customers at the time. There is no variety in the brunch menu, however, it was soooo good that the lack of options were quickly forgotten as we enjoyed our eggs and sides and really, really good cocktails. The bloody mary was great and the michelada is one of the best we have had in the neighborhood. The menu they have for lunch/dinner looks really interesting as well so next time we'll be coming back later in the day to sample everything else. It generally looks really busy in the evenings but the dining/bar area seams open and spacious enough that it shouldn't be a problem to find a seat.","KimbalPeudle M."
"Dylan Murphy's",4,"2016-11-16","I've been to Dylan Murphy's quite a few times because I have friends who live on the upper east side right around the corner. When we want to 'slide into the DM's' it is usually late at night after our other nighttime escapades. Great Irish pub to grab a few drinks with friends whether it is late at night like what me and my friends do, to hang out after work, or to watch a game. The waitstaff is hilarious and very friendly. Dylan Murphy's also has a small bar downstairs that you can rent out for a party. My friends have rented it out one time and I highly recommend it. You get your own bartender and just have to reach a certain price minimum between the people in your party. I enjoy it as much as Peter pan enjoys saving the day from Captain Nook...I mean Hook...Needless to say I was hooked on the nook!","Joshua O."

"Dylan Murphy's",1,"2017-01-22","This place racially profiled my friend who is African American. We went to this bar after the packer vs falcons game.  After getting into the bar and getting a drink my friend was told by a cocktail waitress that she couldn't stay there even though she was waiting for me to buy a drink.   More to the story but blatant racism. Never patronize this place.","Russell M."

"Dylan Murphy's",4,"2016-05-08","I have been here a number of times in the last few years.  Only a complete block-head would write that this place is 100% bridge and tunnel people. The crowd is mostly New Yorkers and locals for the most part.  It has a real, 'Neighborhood Bar Feel.' They have a decent beer selection for an Irish Pub.  Note the words, 'Irish Pub.'  Hipsters go back to Brooklyn where you belong if you want, 'Craft Beers,' or warm piss in a can. Food is very good for Pub Grub, standard Burgers, Fish n' Chips, Bangers and Mash etc.  I would give the wings a B+ as they are pretty juicy for the most part.  Not from skinny chickens as is the case at many places. Nice homey feel.  Open at 12 for a Guinness, lunch and a read of the newspaper.  People leave you alone, nobody hassles you.  Good for a late night soak as well.  The bartenders are very helpful if you end up in your cups. N.B. - Check in on Yelp for complementary shots.","Rob S."

Had buffalo/BBQ wings, onion rings, pigs in a blanket, mozz sticks and buffalo chicken nachos.  Mozz sticks stole the show and nachos need some work (more cheese for all chips).  Great upstairs and downstairs for private parties.  Overall great spot and cowboys lost that's a good thing too!","Aaron R."

"Dylan Murphy's",1,"2017-01-23","Racist Owner.  This was the second bar we walked into on 1/22/2017 (big Sunday football) While waiting off to the side, while my friends got their drinks at the bar, I was approached by a waitress.  She asked me if she could help me with anything, I replied 'I'm ok, thank you' (I'm black btw).  She than asked, nothing to drink? nothing to eat?, I replied no to both (was drinking all afternoon, so I was pacing myself).  She than asked, if I was waiting for the bathroom, I replied no to that as well.  She than told me that I could not stay.  These words came out of her mouth.  Shocked of course, I than asked her 'I can't stay even though my friends (who are all white) are all drinking?' She than quickly replied, oh I thought you were alone, I thought you were alone and quickly walked off. (I guess they don't think black and white people hang out?)  The owner, who initiated this whole thing, stood by in the corner and watched the entire exchange.  I should add, one of the girls that was with us (who was white), was standing next to me without a drink in her hand (yet) and she was never approached or bothered.  I'm writing this review to share my experience at this establishment.  I'm the absolute last person to ever scream racism, but put yourself in my shoes for a sec, and see if you can call it anything else.  I'm a lifelong New Yorker, who loves going out and having drinks with friends, this experience will not change that.  I refuse it to.","Betty J."

It's small, but it does have a downstairs if you want to have a private party. The bartenders are really nice and have been there a while.  As a girl, it's hard to find a place to feel safe late at night alone and the bartenders here here really look out for you. Danny and Taylor are the best--they are a great time. Jack, one of the owners, is one of the nicest people. The staff there seems more like a family (which I totally wish I had at work).

"Dylan Murphy's",5,"2015-03-11","Have to give a five-star rating to the best bar in NYC with the friendliest bartenders in the world and the most unbelievably amazing chicken fingers and burgers (with fried egg on top!). Seriously, the chicken fingers are the best I've ever had, and most people agree when I take them there and make them try it. And I take EVERYONE to Dylan Murphy's!  It's the perfect place to go for football Sunday, late-night Friday or a random Wednesday after work. The Nook bar downstairs is great for hosting parties too. I'll always love you DM!","Kate M."
"Dylan Murphy's",3,"2011-10-04","Following a Museum Mile Poetry Crawl, our intimate party of three ventured to commemorate the festivities with drinks and dinner at Dylan Murphy's.  Burgers for all (two Dylan Murphy's, and one Turkey burger) at $6.95 were plentiful for the hungry and weary to dispel darkness.  Dylan Murphy's to my D-Lite's disappointment do not carry Hoegaarden Spéciale, a full-bodied rich Belgian style wheat beer.  Yet with two guys and one girl, I was nearly reaching enlightenment as I finally do not have to share for my wish became a reality!! Service was without life as the waiter has no facial expression of dysthemia, which as the better person I kill her with sprightly lively joy of smiles.  The waitress glared at me as if there were something wrong with me for her response!!  Does it kill one to smile sincerely to patrons after placing their order, who is employed in the hospitality and customer service environment??  I've been in the customer service industry far too long of six years to know of good customer service!!!   Upper East Side's Irish pub to check-in the ongoings of one's sport team(s) and induce the spirit of merriment in group settings.  On a Saturday night it was rather quite dead or was the ailing economy discouraging patrons from a night of good clean fun??  Don't knock it as their burgers are slightly a step above McDonald's and their French Fries are also okay laa3, but not entirely delicious to die for as there is no sold definitive underwriting.  Dylan Murphy's is okay laa3.","Tina C."
"Dylan Murphy's",2,"2011-12-22","Awful service.  The server/bartender looked pissed off and I was genuinely scared of her. She never asked if I wanted more drinks and seemed to angry to be bothered if I were to ask her to have another one. I don't think I will come here again, there are more lively bars within a 50 foot radius.","Sara N."
"Dylan Murphy's",5,"2015-02-24","I can't express how much I like this spot. Kinda my 'neighborhood spot'as of late. I love the Stella cider they have on tap that I cannot find really any where else on the ues. Also, carley Danny and jerrah are all amazing. I came back a second time because of carley and now I feel like family. I've met one of the owners and he was also super sweet.... Not common in the bar business. You can tell everyone likes their jobs and it makes the experience so much better! Weds wing night is great too! See you guys tomorrow!","Sarah Rylee F."
"Dylan Murphy's",3,"2011-09-15","Made my way here last night after a long day at work and decided to grab a pint. Not a bad little Irish pub on the UES. Nice decor, clean, flat screens, good bartenders. Standard crafty beer list on tap but nothing to rave about. Some nice specials going on - .50 cent wings and $10 beer-burger-fries deal during 4-8 happy hour. Seems like they have specials going on all week. Definitely a locals type of bar. About ten people in here around 10PM when I dropped in. Not a total frat party, but when some of the regs started singing along to a Tom Petty and then a Bon Jovi song I gagged a bit on my beer.","Phil H."

"Dylan Murphy's",3,"2012-10-14","Run of the mill bar, nothing too unique about it. I was plesantly surprised at it not being packed on a Saturday night and they had $10 pitchers of Budlight.

"Dylan Murphy's",1,"2015-02-13","Definitely not feeling this place at all. Walked by after being out downtown and a friend just had to walk in because she heard Micahel Jackson playing. We got beers and they smelled and tasted so bad. Something was not right. One friend got a mixed drink and it was so watered down, it actually tasted like water. Wasn't really feeling the vibe anyway so we tried to finish our drinks (I ditched my beer, it was that bad) and left ASAP. I accidently checked in here twice and I definitely didn't mean to because I won't be coming back.","Yttik V."
"Dylan Murphy's",1,"2011-10-30","Thanks, Dylan Murphy's. Thanks for ruining my Halloween with your false advertising. We were boppin' around the UES and wanted to find a chill bar WITH some sort of costume contest since I'd worked so hard on my getup. We settled on Dylan Murphy's because their website advertised a contest at midnight with $200/$100 prizes. We walked in the front door and one of our first questions to the bartender was, 'Your website advertised a contest at midnight, are you guys still doing that?' The question was asked because there were very few people in costume (making my chances better, right??) and she affirmed they'd be having it.  Well.... midnight came and went, no contest. We thought they were just waiting for more people to come in with costumes, ok. I can dig that. 'round about 1am I asked again and the bartender was like, 'ooooh.... we're not doing that anymore.' Really??! Then why did I stay here because this place was a dirty hole and was not the scene our group was looking for on Halloween. What a waste of my time and my friends' time! I could have gone somewhere else and at least had a shot or we could have gone elsewhere and had a better Halloween crowd, but nope. I was bamboozled into staying at a sub par bar.  I wanted to talk to the manager and she REFUSED to bring him over. What a crock! First of all, I'm very mild mannered in real life and wouldn't have yelled at the guy but would have told him he should honor the information on the bar's website and, second of all, the least the bartender could have done is given us a round on the house or something to try to appease us instead of acting snotty. She clearly hates her job, the bar, and her patrons. If she hates the place and is that annoyed, she should find another bar or - better yet - another profession. It's too bad that this place is so awful because it's really convenient to my friend's place and we could have become regulars if we'd had a decent experience and, really, all they would have had to do is run the contest they advertised. I didn't need to win, but I at least wanted a chance to enter. If they didn't honor the information about the costume contest, how can you ever be sure that any of the other information on their website is true??","Holly N."
"Dylan Murphy's",3,"2012-10-30","This bar receives brownie points in my mind for being open during the hurricane. Walking around with some friends, we didn't know if we would be able to find anywhere to grab dinner. Lucky for us, Dylan Murphy's kitchen was open. The food was okay. I ordered the chicken pot pie which would have been great if the chicken hadn't been on the dry side. My friends seemed equally enthused, although this is a bar so we weren't expecting gourmet food.  The atmosphere, on the other hand, was decent. Great music, everyone enjoyed their beers, and everyone was relaxed despite the hurricane going on around us.","Becca I."

When you are looking for cheap fast eats on a Friday and pregaming a little.  Drop by.  Waitress is very enthusiastic.  Bartenders are pretty awesome.  I accidentally left my package here and came back for it after 1:30am and I get hit by some drunk d*bag.  Bartenders made it all better by a round of shots.  Still!

"Dylan Murphy's",1,"2012-11-24","To begin the food is terrible at best. The fries were over-cooked and cold while the grilled cheese was dry toasted bread with cheese slices tossed betweeen. That said I still thought the service was acceptable until I spoke to a manager about the food. He was fine with it but a bartender decided to argue about it. At that point it went downhill quickly. Obviously I won't be going back when there are so many better options on the UES.","Paul F."
"Dylan Murphy's",3,"2011-08-29","This is NOT you're standard frat bar...huh? There are many locals of all ages, shapes and sizes that are not 'frat-like', so there ya go. What this place is is a solid go-to for cheap drinks, good food specials, and now-serving brunch. The choices are limited to the typical options; pancakes, eggs benedict, breakfast burrito, french toast..but the price (around $10-12) comes with a mimosa or blood mary. The bloody was your run of the mill drink but pretty large in size which was nice. We came here the morning after the hurricane of the century, and we had great service by the only waitress/ bartendar working. They also had the bar options available this particular morning, but not sure if that is always true of brunch time. The wings are slightly above average because I can't seem to find a bloody wing place in this city worth going back to... In summary, your intentions, fellow yelper, of categorizing this as a 'standard UES frat bar' doesn't fit the bill here; walk by every day (as I do), and you'll find a mixed bag of people, so for you sorority folk, don't come here expecting a meat market..you want that, try Mad River..","Katy D."

"Dylan Murphy's",3,"2011-08-29","I wrote a great review about these guys some time back. I think I spoke too soon after finding a decent neighborhood bar. I still like it very much. But they have since stopped serving Delirium. Also, the Christmas spirit has managed to seep into Dylan Murphy's and it's not fun. Someone needs to make sure that jukebox doesn't have xmas music as an option.  Perhaps my wide, n00b eyes have narrowed a bit. It's still a cool bar. I still like the food and the daily meal/beer deals. It's still my default choice of bar by my place. But it's nothing amazing. It does the basics well.","Monica J."

I went in there for a drink and the bartender practically threw it at me and mumbled something under his breath. If he would have rolled his eyes, his attitude problem would have been complete. Not worth dealing with bartender cr*p, considering that there's a great place just down the block.","Harley Q."
"Dylan Murphy's",4,"2014-04-06","Very friendly, casual place. Had wings and tasted sliders. I would order again. Wigs were deep fried with franks sauce.

"Dylan Murphy's",3,"2012-05-05","This place is up Yelp's butt so check in with all those deals, yo! An Irish pub (what else on the UES, or really, anywhere in the city?) with more patrons connected to smartphones, iPads and whatever the hell Dr. Dre is soliciting as headphones than patrons connected to a shot of Powers whiskey and a Smiddick's. Pumping the Top 40's dance hits lightly in the happy hour din against the open facade on a spring evening as the 3rd Ave. taxis whisk up the avenue. Seems like a bar in search of an identity. And a cash flow.","Mike O."

"Dylan Murphy's",4,"2009-03-16","Do you know that obnoxious frat party that doubles as an annoying bar on the UES? Yeah. Mad River. Do yourself a favor walk to the door, turn around and walk diagonally across the street, toward the Seven-Eleven. Look directly to the left and there you will find Dylan Murphy's.  I like it because it's convenient. They pull Blue Moon, Stella, and Sierra Nevada, and it usually isn't overcrowded. When I'm drinking I'm usually focused on racing myself to drunk or full from countless beers, and not so concerned about people watching or picking up girls. Sometimes I even like talking to people and having a conversation over a few pints. Dylan Murphy's is a viable candidate.  They also have a downstairs bar area, directly across from the little boys room [restroom, not Neverland Ranch], but I've never had a drink down there (read: I saw what happened to Webster, MacCauley Culkin, and Bubbles the Chimp).  All in all, it's a decent bar and a more 'local' option compared to Mad River.  *Note: the first time I came to this bar, I almost wet myself when I saw two girls cheering for James Madison University football. If you don't know why that is more funny than my Michael Jackson reference, please don't FUC me.","Chris J."
"Dylan Murphy's",5,"2013-07-29","One of my absolute favorite bars in the city! Spent some time living on the Upper East Side this summer and started going for their trivia nights on Mondays. Trivia is always a blast-- I now trek up from Bushwick and it's totally worth it. Everyone who plays trivia has a great time and it's a great way to spend a Monday night. Overall great atmosphere and the bartenders are all fantastic. Definitely has a neighborhood casual vibe, everyone who plays trivia is chatty and you get to know the regulars at the bar. Really welcoming place with pretty good deals-- $12 for a beer, burger and fries on Monday nights, cheap pitchers, etc. Doesn't get very crowded although I'm usually their during off hours so I'm not sure how it is at peak times on Friday and Saturday nights. Probably not what you're looking for if you want something trendy but it's very solid as a pub and goes above and beyond what you'd expect for service. I'll definitely keep going back to catch up with my favorite bartenders and (maybe) one day actually win trivia night!","Amber L."

Draught list is nothing to write home about, but definitely steps up from the standard American macros -- Chimay is generally on, as well as Boddington's.  A good place to escape the frantic meat market atmosphere that pervades so many bars in the vicinity.  As a side note, bartenders are friendly and unobtrusive.","nate r."

The bartender, named Jack, was so entertaining, and the bar so thoroughly comfy, that we ended up staying and drinking all night.  No food yet, but we were told it was coming soon, as the place was new.  They're also building a downstairs, which should be interesting.  No pool or darts, which is a bit of a minus, but good beers on tap, good music selection, and bar crack all made up for it though.  Good times.","Doug R."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-03-16","I've always loved the original downtown La Esquina and am so happy this new location opened a block from my office. Sure it's on the pricey side for tacos but it's totally reasonable for the area and the quality is worth it. Their fish tacos have always been high on my list, and the bistec con queso (rib eye) and barbacoa (lamb shoulder) are delicious, if a bit messy. For a while when they opened, they had a Carnegie-Deli tribute reuben taco that was amazing. I hope they bring it back and/or have more specials! My favorite thing on the menu may even be the veggie quesadilla - they use white and purple cauliflower (it's pretty!) cooked just right with a little bite and corn tortillas instead of flour, something I appreciate as I tell myself it's OK to eat Mexican food every day because it's healthy and gluten free.  There are a couple nice counter spots and some tables in a separate section up some stairs, but this is mostly a to-go spot. Waiting can get quite crowded and jumbled but the kitchen seems to have gotten it together more each time I go in, so it's not a terribly long wait.","Sherri H."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-03-16","Food portions are small, but the flavor and decor make up for it!  This spot is perfect for dinner w a friend or two because seating is limited (about 10 couples could be seated at once), but well worth it.  I got the Plato Julia w rib eye ($12), which was tasty and fresh, but mostly rice and beans.  The meal came w a small sliced avocado and cheese, too.  My friend got the hamburger torta ($10), which looked and smelled delicious-- definitely going to try that next time.  She also got the blood orange margarita, which was just the right amount of tequila and blood orange juice. If you're looking for a quick bite, but in a sit-down atmosphere, then this is the place!","Ellen P."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-03-10","Went last night for tacos and a margarita. I got the sliced rib eye taco, the lamb shoulder, and the cauliflower. My boyfriend got the cauliflower, two fish tacos, and the side of black beans.  The black beans were a killer deal for $2 and tasty, but the lamb shoulder taco was my highlight! Decadent, flavorful, & juicy! I was so glad I got it. It was rich though so glad I got a cauliflower to balance it out. Cauliflower taco wasn't exciting but the crunchy texture of the cauliflower was impressive. Sliced rib eye was ok, the cheese was really good on it.  We enjoyed our meal! Taking a star off since the seating situation isn't great here and my boyfriend's beer came out warm.","Alexis H."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-02-18","great option if you are in the area and need to refuel :)  There's seating area. You order and pay up front and then there they deliver it to you. It's just better than pizza and other tourist traps - especially when not a tourist lol. They ran out of lamb taco so ordered the chicken, and fish. Chicken was very good. Fish was ok not bad - disappointed because it wasn't tempura or have any type of breading or crust.  Also tried their torta vegetarian - interesting lol. The bread was good, the filling and sauce, was ok.. lol","Heidi C."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-03-04","Tacos all day every day! So glad this joint opened another location in Midtown because it's really really good. True it's not as cheap as most hole-in-the-walls, especially coming from LA where we really know our tacos. I still loved the meats and flavors and the options. Also would suggest getting the corn! It's close to where I work, and I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the tacos I didn't have a chance to try.","Claire W."
"La Esquina",3,"2017-01-30","Taco joint right outside the 57th and 7th stop on the N/Q/R/W train. Inexpensive tacos. Slow service. Chips do not come with the guacamole.  Antique decor. Cozy space - they have more tables in the lofted area.","Susan A."

"La Esquina",4,"2016-12-13","A new location of the popular downtown spot has opened much further uptown. Instead of the somewhat confusing three different choices downtown (the hidden sit down restaurant, the quick service counter spot and the more casual table service option), this one is just a simple menu of tacos, quesadillas and tortas in a single room with a few additional tables up a small flight of stairs. The tacos are great, especially the Ribeye Con Queso. The Tortas are ok too, but definitely stick with the tacos.","Mike C."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-01-02","4 star. The coolest part about La Esquina is its decorations. They used recycled items like tomato soup cans and plastic bottles for its napkin holders and lamp shades. It transports me out of the bustling, neighborhood-less part of New York city into a cantina. I could be in Cimarron, New Mexico on a backpacking trip. I could be in Mexico. The tacos and quesadilla, while good, aren't super special, but I really appreciated the mayo corn. Perfectly covered, a little spicy. Another added benefit is that it's right outside the nqrw subway stop on my walk home from work.... So wouldn't be surprised if I became a regular!","Willy X."
"La Esquina",5,"2017-02-14","Yasss the cool downtown vibes of La Esquina has come to midtown. Loved the corn, pastrami and fish tacos. Beware of the habanero salsa! -- If you use too much just wash it down with a passionfruit margarita or two ;) Great for a date spot or a casual night with friends. I look forward to coming back!","Joanna L."
"La Esquina",3,"2017-02-25","Been dying to try them since their LES location is truly out of way for me. So when the midtown location opened, I was looking forward to it.  The verdict:  -Tiny tacos with big flavor. Tried rib eye, chicken, and fish. Would order the rib eye and chicken again. Fish (grilled) was ok - not breaded or fried in case you're looking for that. Actually liked that it wasn't fried, but it was a bit dry.  -Love how you can tailor your guac according to your taste.  -Elota was 'meh'. I've had better at the street carts in Jackson Heights, Queens.  -Rice and beans were decent.  -Prices are high, as expected.  Go with the rib eye tacos.  I didn't try the tortas as other reviews said to stick to tacos. A little surprised they didn't do the double corn tortilla like other authentic Mexican places do. Seats are limited to a couple of tables and stool/bar seating.  Lunch crowd on weekdays gets crowded. But they're in and out quick. Order at the counter and wait for your number to get called.  Probably not coming back and waiting to fulfill my taco craving at a closer place to home and where the portions are bigger for what you pay.","Jamlen F."

"La Esquina",5,"2017-02-20","Love this place! They were out of the fish tacos when we went but the cauliflower tacos were quite good! The spices on the corn were really strong - good but not my favorite (just a personal preference; the bf really liked it). The guacamole was good - perfect consistency but more citrusy than I normally like (again just a personal preference; the bf loved it and licked it clean). And the rice/beans were also good. Overall a very solid place! Will definitely be returning!","Tansy W."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-02-13","Had the ribeye taco & chicken. It was pretty tasty. I've read reviews about how inexpensive the tacos but compared to how much I pay for them at home it's very expensive! I think that's the most I've ever paid for a taco about 10 bucks for 2 tacos! Crazy. My favorite food there was the chicken tortilla soup. It was pretty spicy and full of flavor. Of you like soups get it! Servings are pretty small.","Johnny B."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-02-26","Being from California I constantly have a craving for Mexican food and in New York it is quite hard to fulfill. However, when a few of my girlfriends and I went out to dinner we happened to stumble upon this great restaurant!  It looks like it's a restaurant off of the PCH and has a very authentic vibe. I got the carnitas tacos and a passion fruit margarita which were both very delicious! One of the best margaritas I've had in New York. The carnitas were very tender and flavorful. Prices aren't bad considering they're located in midtown Manhattan. My only complaint was the lack of seating. But then again it was a Friday night and there were 6 of us altogether. Even then, we were able to sit down and have a nice meal.  I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try! I will definitely be going back soon!!","Hannah T."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-02-03","This place is amazing...if you have the time to wait. 18 mins for two tacos is a bit long, but honestly they were worth it. The pescado tacos were amazing, the califlor tacos could use a little more spice. Totally authentic, love the decor, music, and the fact that it's 90 degrees in here when it's 14 outside.  I'll be back!","Jessica S."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-01-23","Good Mexican food! The quesadillas were good and the salsa was superb and the margarita amazing! No fuss, warm and a hidden gem!They need to have free wifi.","Anu S."
"La Esquina",5,"2017-02-09","Very fast service, delicious food!  We were a little confused at first about whether or not you are supposed to sit and be served... but this place is one of those where you place your order with the cashier, then when it's ready they bring your order out and call out your order number.  Seating is limited and erratic but also cute and cozy. Would not recommend for large parties. Food came out quickly and our alcoholic beverages were brought out immediately so we could drink while we waited. A jug of water with cups (free and you don't have to ask!) is available near the cash register. I ordered the tortilla soup, corn, rice and beans. The corn was AMAZING - it's a full corn-on-the-cob with the standard Mexican street corn toppings. I probably could have eaten two!","Christie S."
"La Esquina",1,"2017-03-07","Went for margarita. Manager was horrible!! Asked about a news review that said they offer Margaritas at a certain price and they said it was shots only. Manager did nothing to try n at least go half with us on what the post said. I have had way better authentic tacos.","Azuleni G."
"La Esquina",4,"2016-12-30","A really nice space, very good service, and excellent food. The prices may be a bit jarring at first, but this is totally worth the  price and actually a good value when you compare it to other Mexican options in Midtown.  The ingredients are high quality and fresh and make for exception food. I was taken aback by the high price points, but this isn't Chipotle, you are getting fine dining quality food in a fast casual setting.  Totally worth a visit and a nice part of the Midtown West  lunch rotation.","Danesh I."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-03-05","Very cute place! The tacos are pretty good. A great place if you want something quick. The staff was very nice. The price is a bit high but I guess it is New York. I got the corn, I'm pretty sure that was under cooked and was also cold. I would skip on that. The chips are really good. I'm sure they make it in house. You do have to buy the guacamole ($9!) separately which sucks.","Thu N."

"La Esquina",5,"2017-02-09","This is by far the best taco spot I've been to yet in the city. From the the decor to the food, everything is so fresh and exciting. Also everyone who works here is extremely nice and will talk to you. Crystal is so nice, and genuinely cares about your experience here. Plus they have a full bar. The music is amazing. Hip hop and chill music, Its definitely the coolest place in the area. Amazing! I'll come back very very soon.","Mia L."
"La Esquina",1,"2017-03-05","Do not order takeout from this restaurant. Food arrived 1.5 hours after ordered, despite the fact that my apartment is only 50 yards away (yes, I now know, I should have just picked it up myself, but on the other hand a restaurant should not offer delivery if it takes that long just to cross the street).  Upon arrival the food was ice cold and unbearably salty -- and I like salty food.  DO NOT DO THIS!!!","Paul H."
"La Esquina",5,"2017-02-25","So I was in the mood for some Mexican food so I hit up good old Yelp, and there was La Esquina!! What a choice!!! It was excellent, I got 3 tacos; Bistec (steak), Pollo (chicken) and the Barbados (lamb). All I can say is WOW!! My only regret is not going there sooner!!! I forgot to order the grilled corn, but there is always next time!!!","Mike S."
"La Esquina",5,"2017-02-09","Late night tacos??? Who can deny them ? This is a gem don't skip don't judge . Eat tacos Here ... Get drunk first , because who doesn't want a bomb taco when they are totally wasted ?!? Listen just go here order whatever you see first and eat you will not be disappointed.","Tati S."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-02-23","The food it's really amazing, great Mexican flavor, I love coming here, the service it's fast. But they need to improve their customer service with the people working behind the kitchen, when you ask for something it's like they don't even look at you. They charge almost $5 dlls for a taco, so if people pay for that they should get the best customer service, that's why Sometimes I don't tip them, because you are the one that has to stand up and get the food from the counter. Why would they expect a tip if you don't give a kind smile to your customer?","Yajaira R."
"La Esquina",4,"2016-12-19","they make the tortillas fresh right in front of you!!! very high quality , real Mexican taqueria feel. kinda pricey for a taqueria due to the location but the food is very good... nice quesadillas. they just opened and told me they will have a liquor license in a week or so. cool laid back atmosphere...","Mark N."
"La Esquina",4,"2016-12-12","Much needed in the neighborhood. They have great vegetarian options, take cash and credit. Short lines, they've just opened, and the service is already pretty quick.  Fantastic for lunch or dinner. They also serve drinks!","priya S."
"La Esquina",1,"2017-02-15","Check your order carefully!  Walked a good distance (and waited a long time) to get take-out from here, and when I got back to my desk, realized that they left out half of my order.  What I had was good, but I was left hungry,","Adam K."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-02-02","It's a great price for fresh Mexican! It's costs a little more than average Mexican, but the food is really good. Very fresh, service was slow, but really everyone was really nice. I loved the beef tacos.","Julia K."

"La Esquina",5,"2017-01-22","Had the carnitas tacos, quac and chips, and the hibiscus drink. Carnitas were juicy and flavorful, the good size guac portion came with onion tomato and jalapeno to mix in. Hibiscus drink was very flavorful and had fresh bits floating around in it. All in all highly recommended!","Tyler M."

"La Esquina",4,"2017-01-27","order and pay then find a seat and eat. fast mexican on the corner (Esquina!). Tacos and sides were tasty. Horchata was pleasant and not too sweet.

"La Esquina",3,"2017-02-10","Tacos were good, but the corn was amazing. Service was a bit slow but it figures seeming as it was lunch time. I agree with most posters about them being overpriced though. Not enough food for what they charge you.","Toshana W."
"La Esquina",4,"2017-02-27","The tacos are so delicious here. The sauces, just the perfect amount of spicy...loved them! Very cute interior to this restaurant. We had to go up for seconds (you have to order at the counter). Worth it for such a yummy treat.","Theresa C."
"La Esquina",2,"2017-02-23","DON'T DO IT. Absurdly overpriced for pathetically undersized portions.  Food was ok, but far from the best (or even other good) tacos you can get in the area.  Sure, it's organic cornmeal, but so what?!?  Paid $13 for 3 mini tacos, only to be starving again 2 hours later.  Never again.","Eran S."
"La Esquina",5,"2017-02-09","Great tacos and same as their Soho location.  Not busy in the evenings since its a casual place.  Traditional small tacos.  Nice place to grab a quick meal.","Salvatore S."
"La Esquina",2,"2017-01-28","Food was ok but way too overpriced. They nickel and dime you for everything. I asked for a side of salsa and I was told I had to buy a can off of the shelf for $5 as if I had a refrigerator to store what was left after I was done since it was huge and I only wanted a side not a months supply. The tacos were decent but if you get the ribeye don't expect much meat. I ordered a margarita first which I had to ask for twice but didn't receive until I was half way done with my food. They serve a very small portion of guacamole for $9, also a total rip off. They then top the guacamole with tomatoes, onions, cilantro and jalapeños if you want but they don't mix it and the already small cup and also already full cup is hard to mix on your own without everything spilling out. This place is very money hungry. I know every place is but if I notice it's probably a little overboard. The receipt has the recommended 15% 18% and 20% tip guide but they call your number and you pick up your own food, so who really tips more than a couple bucks for that. So, if you want to pay 50 bucks for 3 tacos, some guacamole, a cup of soup and a margarita that are just average tasting and wanna feel raped when you leave, this is your place.","Shannen F."
"La Esquina",2,"2016-12-16","I live right in the neighborhood and there are some really good mexican food places around here.  La Esquina has decent tacos, BUT WAY OVER PRICED! The burger is a joke!  It comes entirely plain.  If you are going to sell a burger to New Yorkers, you better include a pickle and some fries.  All and all, the food was edible, but there are many other places to get good mexican food around here.  I would not recommend this place to a friend or to a family member.","René R."
"La Esquina",2,"2017-02-12","After trying several Mexican Taquerias in New York City I decided to go stop by and eat at 'the corner' taqueria. Restaurant style was unique and well developed. Food presentation was okay. Quantity was a total disappointment, $4.25 and $3.75 for a lot of onions but barely any meat. And taste was not I was expecting. Too much oil and not enough seasoning. And as a fan of Mexican taquerias I would recommend adding a little more effort and love on their food.","Carlos G."
"La Esquina",3,"2016-12-27","It's overpriced. The tacos are ok (~$4.50 for one taco). Nothing to write home about. Same goes for the elote. I usually measure how good a place is on whether I'd go back and this will not be a repeat for me. The tacos from the taco truck on 53rd between 7th and Broadway are much better and cheaper ($3)!","Steve C."

"La Esquina",4,"2017-01-12","Yayyy, my neighborhood is becoming cool (for once)! Honestly I don't think many would ever consider Midtown West to be an up and coming area but I've began to notice a few pop-ups as of late such as Souvlaki GR, Black Tap and now - La Esquina! They're bringing downtown uptown now, and I, myself, have no complaints. Last week I had the pleasure of strolling into La Esquina, which by the way, was not located on the corner of a street. (La Esquina means corner. Guess it didn't live up to its name.) Anyway, when we happened to walk in on a weekday around 9pm - there were no lines but definitely some patrons around. The space was quite cozy but they have an elevated level with more seating besides the main floor. In addition to being a restaurant, they also offered a variety of goods for sale such as hot sauce, candy, and whatever else I forgot. When you arrive inside you can place your order at the register and there was a separate counter/open kitchen where you can pick up your food. We were seated by the register so we had our food delivered instead. My boyfriend and I ordered plenty of dishes to sample. We had the tortilla soup, pollo torta, carnitas / pescado a la brasas / pollo rotizado tacos, and moros y cristianos (rice & beans). EVERYTHING was delicious!!! Honestly I can't select a favorite from our meal, it was THAT good! Frankly, we were taken aback by how freshly made and flavored each dish was. The cashier was honest as well and held us back from ordering any further because it was enough for us both. At the end of our meal, she was right. It was just enough to fill us up, without going overboard with a self-induced food coma. The bill ran us up to $53.00, fairly priced and it was totally worth it. We're glad to say we highly recommend this joint. Welcome to the neighborhood, La Esquina, we're happy to have you!","Kiki L."
"La Esquina",3,"2016-12-28","So excited that this opened by my job. Had the tortilla soup today... I love that there's queso and avocado in it, but it was too salty.. and I even like salty foods.","Anna M."
"La Esquina",2,"2017-01-04","I'm a big fan of their Kenmare St. location and went there and ordered lunch delivery from there all the time when I worked downtown. So, I was excited that they opened this new location near my new job. What a disappointment. I agree with other reviewers that it's overpriced for what you're going to get. My portions where less than expected for the prices being charged. I kept it simple and ordered a Carnitas taco and an order of Moros Cristianos (rice and beans topped with pico and queso). The container for my order of rice and beans was only half filled. When I placed my order I asked for an extra side of cheese and pico for the rice and beans and was told it was an extra $1 for each! The containers for the extras are  less than an ounce in size. I declined because an extra dollar for a tiny container is a bit exorbitant and I don't recall ever being charged extra at their downtown location. I don't see myself returning to this location after this experience.","Cris B."
"Villalobos",4,"2017-01-23","This Mexican spot was so unexpected in Montclair with the interior it had... Very spacious, bar seating, but I think they're BYOB from what I remember. Anyway, tacos hit the spot. Authentic and flavorful. Are they my favorite tacos ever? Probably not, but they're on the list for north jersey. I'm a big fan of the guacamole flight they offer so you can try all different types or just double up on your favorites - thought that was creative. My absolute favorite thing though? COCA COLA BOTTLES. I'm an absolute sucker for soda out of a glass bottle.","Christina S."
"Villalobos",2,"2017-03-11","MAKE SURE YOU GET TO YOUR RESERVATION VERY EARLY!!!!!! YOUR TABLE WILL BE GIVEN AWAY IF YOURE EVEN A SECOND LATE!!  We were a party of 5 and had reservations for 8:30. 3 of us got there before 8:30 but 2 of us got there at 8:33 and they GAVE OUR TABLE AWAY. We were THREE MINUTES LATE and they gave the table to other people. We had to squeeze into a smaller table while the smaller party had our 5 seated table. I'm still in shock. It was absolutely ridiculous.  The service was slow and nothing special, barely around and had no personality.  The food was pretty good (that's the only reason why there's 2 stars) but it is so unfortunate that the staff is incompetent and inconsiderate.","Ama C."
"Villalobos",1,"2017-02-27","Came here a month or two ago on a weekday with my partner and 1 year old daughter. The place was completely empty. There were two employees (young guys) behind the counter. They didn't greet us or seat us. They just looked at us as we stared at them trying to figure out how things worked at this restaurant we planned on trying for the first time. They didnt appear to be preoccupied doing anything else, as I said, we were the only patrons there. They were looking directly at us so I know they recognized our uncertainty. We had to ask where to sit and one of the guys told us 'anywhere.'  We sat down for about a minute, awkwardly looking across at the employees who never brought us menus, nor said they would be with us in a minute, and never even gave us a proper greeting. We also had to go over and bring our own booster seat to the table. Eventually we just walked out. If the place was packed, this behavior would have been understandable, but there's no reason to ignore customers or make them wait on any  form of service at all when you have NO other customers present on the premises.  I hope this was just a case of two young men (ones name was Dan) with HORRIBLE customer service skills and not an episode of racism, warranting us subpar service because we were black. We felt completely unvalued as customers in that establishment, whatever the case was.  When we left, my partner said he heard one of the guys whisper 'lets do it' when we first entered the restaurant and both guys laugh, before attempting to completely ignore our presence. As soon as we got in the car, he called the restaurant to speak to the manager (who apparently wasnt in that day) about our experience and that's when we discovered one of the guy's names was Dan.  Didn't get a chance to taste the food but 1 (more like 0) stars for atrocious service.","Stephanie S."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-12-22","I feel like tacos spots are really have to compete for who's got the best. These were pretty good but seemed small for the price. My party of 3 got 2 tacos each and a shared appetizer and it close to $50. Granted a couple of us got the special but that's pretty serious for tacos. I had the BBQ brisket taco, one of the specials and must say it was pretty good and looked the part, but just felt it was small. The pork taco was good too, but nothing exciting.  The appetizer sampler we got was an interesting crowd pleaser set of guacamole and salsa dips. They were all nice to sample such as the crab meat dip but my main focus are the tacos and how I'm hung up on the prices. I know this area of Montclair isnt exactly known for deals when it comes to dining out and while the food was solid, you can do better cost wise and with taste too.","Marcus S."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-12-06","So to be fair, I only came here because I had a gift card to help offset the cost. Otherwise I would say it is a bit on the pricey side so maybe just come for drinks or a special occasion. That being said, I was pleased with all the food here. We started with the guacamole sampler that comes with 4 different kinds! One is plain which was delicious, the others included a crab meat version, peanuts and seeds for a nice crunchy texture, as well as a bacon and Brussels sprouts one. These were all interesting and not bad tasting and I certainly appreciated the creativity but wasn't super impressed by any one flavor over the other. I say just stick with the regular guac as it was great! For tacos I had the pulled pork version and the shrimp taco which was recommended over the fish. I was really pleased with the pork taco as it had great flavor and a lot of meat. The shrimp taco was good but a little heavy on the mayo unfortunately.  I would love to come back here if i can afford it or someone else is paying!","Jennifer H."
"Villalobos",5,"2017-03-05","Wow what a find!! We were going to a show in Montclair and tried this place and it is beyond awesome!! Better than the Cuban place around  the corner!! So good ! Try the guacamole flight! So fun !! Love it !!","Liz F."
"Villalobos",4,"2017-01-10","Right away, I knew I'd like the place. The decor was hip and the ambiance was warm. I also came here the day after a snow storm AND it was brick outside, so at 5:30 PM on a Sunday, Montclair was dead to begin with. My friend and I split the guacamole flight, which was more than enough for the two of us (we ended up spooning most of it onto our tacos). My favorite has to be the Peanut and Pumpkinseeds, with Bacon and Brussel Sprouts coming at a close second. The bacon came thick cut chunks and the brussel sprouts were crispy as hell, which is seriously irresistible in my book, but I couldn't deny the crunch that the peanut and pumpkinseeds brought to the table. For tacos, I had the Brisket Barbacoa, Carnitas, and Camarones. My friend had the same thing, switching out the Brisket for Pescado Frito. These tacos were amazinggggggggg. Seriously, the flavor explosion that happens in your mouth is undeniably the greatest thing ever. The only thing I didn't find too nice was how the tacos were a little wet, resulting in a lightly soppy tortilla. It still held together, but broke a teensy bit. Not a big deal, as I just used a fork and got over it.  Yes, the tacos are a little pricey, but I had a Groupon ($16 for $30 worth of food). The total came out to $54, so I really only paid $40. For 6 tacos and a guacamole flight, I wouldn't say that's so terrible.  I'll definitely have to come back and try their specials, appetizers, and entrees!","Jules S."
"Villalobos",4,"2017-02-19","Sooooo I really so love this place. For the people who gave it 1-2 stars for the price, well you get what you pay for! And that's exceptional tacos!! If you want to pay less go to taco bell. My only disappointment today is the guac. I LOVE the guac and I haven't been in here in a long time, so I was sad when the guac came half empty, with hardly any bacon. I have attached a before and after. Listen, I get it, times are tough. I'd rather you raise the price and give me the same amount. It's worth the $$!!","Dee R."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-12-13","I like the ambience in this place and the tacos are delicious. However, the meals (including tacos) and drinks are a little on the pricy side. I had the rock shrimp tacos and my group had the salsa samplers. All the salsas were unique and delicious, varying in level of sweetness and spiciness. Definitely make a reservation during peak times.","Melanie T."
"Villalobos",4,"2017-02-17","Fabulous restaurant.  Great staff, positive vibe and the food is excellent.  Creative well thought out tacos and interesting appetizers.","J B."
"Villalobos",3,"2017-03-04","UPDATED: this used to be our favorite place but the last 3 times we went service was ridiculously slow & inattentive (15 minutes for more tortilla chips, 20 minutes for more water, etc) and the food did not taste as great. The scallop taco was my favorite of the bunch (we've tried them all) but they don't have it anymore, which is a crying shame, seriously. They also don't have the ahi tuna appetizer anymore either (a disappointment shared with other diners sitting around us when they heard our gasps). To be honest, the rest of the tacos taste pretty bland and chewy lately... so bottom line is: we aren't visiting this place anymore and we're honestly sad about it. Villalobos was our go-to date night spot, now we're in search of something new :( If the owners are reading this, hopefully they take note and can bounce back, we'd be happy to come back in and try again but just don't want to be disappointed again.","Jennifer C."

"Villalobos",4,"2016-03-25","Go if you're a fan of byob and tacos! The tacos are unique and delicious! I enjoyed the shrimp, steak and hamburger tacos. It was absolutely delicious. As my appetizer I had the guacamole and with brussel sprouts and bacon. It had a bland and boring taste to it. It was missing something in the mix of ingredients that they developed. I was able to bring my own bottle of champagne which was lovely and the service was phenomenal. Taylor was my server and he was not only attentive he was very friendly. Everyone that worked in the restaurant seemed very helpful and friendly throughout my dining experience.","Ashley J."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-03-30","The only bad thing about eating in this restaurant is the fact that my tolerance for spice is not as high as I thought. I suggested to my boyfriend that we come here for my birthday because I love tacos and salsa and all things spicy. We started with three different salsas; chipotle honey, verde crudo and the habanero pineapple and all the homemade chips we could handle. We both handle spice pretty well but the combination of all three made it difficult to taste anything else, BUT it was great. I enjoyed every chip full. After a lot of water we each ordered two tacos; the pescado frito, carne asada, verduras, and camarones which we both enjoyed very much. I think this place has a great atmosphere but the tables get really crowed so I prefer to sit at the bar with my bottle of wine and have more salsa next time I'm back.","Jessie V."
"Villalobos",2,"2016-10-11","This place looks good, but looks can be deceiving. The meals are the size of quarter dollars. They are very expensive as well. Service was fine, just the food was bleh. The meat was dry and the meals looked like they came of the kids menu. Moral of the Story- If you like a big, sloppy, guacamole filled authentic Mexican meal, go to Casa Piquin.","Honey N."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-05-10","Came here on a few occasions, a few dinner dates and then I loved it so much that I brought my friends here for my birthday dinner this past March.  So needless to say, its a pretty outstanding taco place. One thing I love about this restaurant is that when you sit at the bar you get to watch all the chefs in the kitchen.  I just appreciate the quick paced and hectic atmosphere and yet it all seemed to run so smoothly. It was a little tricky bringing a big group here (~15 people).  The restaurant itself is a good size, but the tables and chairs seemed small.  So they put us in the back corner, which was fine for us since we got our own little section, but it was a little hard maneuvering all of the various plates of tacos, hot sauces (the Macha is a DEFINITE must have), guac, etc. But I had a blast regardless.  We brought our own drinks and ended up mixing some tequila in the various slushes that they offer, pretty sweet but very tasty. If you do plan on coming on a weekend night, make sure to make reservations, otherwise you will be sitting at the bar.","Sarah L."
"Villalobos",5,"2017-01-31","I'm a big fan.  Villalobos doesn't serve the slop that you get at Chile's, so don't go in there expecting unnatural orange colored rice and refried beans.  It is authentic Mexican with fresh ingredients and great flavors.  The chef changes up the menu seasonally and when he comes across great ingredients.  The setting is comfortable and hip, and the staff are friendly and know what they are talking about.  Solid value.  Check it out, you will not be disappointed.","Jeff P."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-10-16","This place looks like a trendier version of a Chipotle with the way the counter and chairs look. Open kitchen is a nice touch, and love that a lot of the ingredients are local. Started off with the guac flight, but skipped the peanut and pumpkinseed flavor because it just didn't sound appealing. Bacon and brussels sprouts guac was delicious and a great combo of flavors with smoky, thick-cut bacon pieces. Crab salad guac was the second best, and I love that they didn't skimp on the amount of crab in there. Traditional guac was just okay and I probably wouldn't order it again. Now, on to the tacos. I got the rock shrimp (camarones) and the carnitas. Shrimp taco was out of this world and I wish I had gotten two of those. Carnitas taco was good, too, but after the shrimp taco it had some pretty big shoes to fill. If you're expecting a $1 taco, try a food truck. This is meant to be a trendy Montclair spot with high-quality, local ingredients, which naturally cost more. Also, portion sizes are perfect (less fat American-sized) and I still left feeling super full after 2 tacos and splitting the chips. Do I want to blow $6 on one small taco every day? No. But would I come back here sometime in the near future on another dinner outing? Absolutely.  Deducted a star because I wish they had kind of margarita or sangria-type drink. I know the place is BYOB but Casa Piquin and Cuban Pete's and other nearby places do serve mixed drinks to which you add your own alcohol. To me, chips and guac without some kind of drink on a Saturday night is blasphemous. There are flavored sodas, but who likes soda? Other than that, keep up the good work, Villalobos!","Ella B."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-01-04","Really tasty tacos!!! We tried them a few days after we arrived from San Diego, CA...where you cant go wrong with delish tacos everywhere. Loved the decor...however, they only need to improve their guacamole a little bit. I personally recommend this place.","Paula S."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-08-24","Went there the first Friday they were open.Despite several two tops being open we were told only the counter was available.Also told that reservations are not taken, so why no table for the two of us.Food was ok.Adam and VJ are nice guys with a good potential business but are trying to create a 'scene.' ideally suited for hipsters under thirty.Noise level was tolerable until the loud music was turned on.I will try again but they need to be more hospitable to all types and ages otherwise they will be closing the door for good.","Jay C."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-03-12","Went here before an 8:00 Thursday night concert at the Wellmont.  Good location to do so...  It's a BYOB, which we didn't know beforehand, so we ran down the road for a bottle of wine.  We got there around 6:00 and were seated immediately.  One of the very attentive busboys poured some water for us and brought us chips and a green salsa and a red salsa (literally, about a tablespoon of each).  The chips/salsa were tasty.  I have been on a beet/arugula salad kick, so when I saw that there was a salad consisting of those items, plus blood orange and pistachios in a Caesar dressing, I was in!  I decided I'd start with that and then ordered 2 tacos -the Pescado (beer battered white fish, cabbage, Serrano, and a cream sauce) and the Al Pastor De Pollo (chicken, pineapple, cilantro, onions).  Hubby ordered the Carne Asado, at $28.  I had asked the waiter a couple of questions before we ordered, he answered them, but walked away before we could order.  About 15 minutes later, the attentive busboy walked over to our waiter, after making eye contact with me, and let him know that we were probably ready to order.  The waiter sauntered over and took our order (we let him know that we were going to a concert)...    My salad came out within a few minutes and although very tasty, it was sooooo freaking salty.  It almost ruined the salad - I'm not sure if it was the dressing or the pistachios, but REALLY SALTY.  (I mentioned that to 2 women who were seated next to us and contemplating ordering it - I said it was very good, but VERY salty).  About 7 minutes later our food came out.  Now, for $28, my hubby was expecting a steak.  What he received was literally about the size of a hockey puck (cooked to the correct temperature, just a tiny bite sized piece of steak).  It was tasty, I tried some of the 'bone marrow butter' off the top and that was really good - a nice flavor to accent the puny piece of meat (Where's the BEEF???)  My tacos were 'eh'.  The fish taco had ZERO flavor except for a really potent HOT pepper flavor, which was not enjoyable at all.  there was no other flavor - very bland...just an 'in your face' heat from the pepper (I mentioned that to the waiter when he came by - he said just to let them know not to add the pepper - they add it an the end of cooking - hence the reason it's so 'in your face').  The chicken was not memorable.  After we finished (hubby was ready to find a Burger King at that point, because he was still hungry!), the busboy took away our plates, and we sat....and sat....and sat.  Finally, the busboy, AGAIN, motioned to our waiter, and he brought us the check.  We literally made it to the theater (which is maybe a 5 minute walk) by 8:00.  2 hours, for mediocre food, and $55 later, we had already decided that Villalobos was a 'one and done' for us.  Been there, done that, not impressed.","Linda G."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-07-31","Food was amazing. The Carnitas tacos outstanding!  Great location. Service was very good our waitress was nice, informative, friendly, and efficient. My only complaint is that the waitress broke my glass with wine already in it (rendering the wine undrinkable) and no one offered us any discount, comp or to buy a new bottle of wine. I mean, it ruin a huge glass of wine. That being said, she was very apologetic.","Christine F."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-08-15","it's all about the simplicity here. it's tasty and the ingredients are fresh. we're here on opening week and it's crazy packed to the point where they're turning people away. had carnitas, barbacoa and pescado tacos as well as the villalobos guac (why not right?) and it's all fantastic. there's a very particular attention to detail with how everything is made and it shows with every bite. there's plenty of variety to choose from so we're definitely going to be back for more.","Roman A."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-03-14","How does a Mexican place make flavorless tacos? Nothing special about the food here but how overpriced this.","Eugene R."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-03-29","Service and ambiance were great, as was the location. The dishes are different and creative but unfortunately many were misses. The guacamole is the most bland and disappointing part -- we came here twice and each time it tasted the same. The tacos were hits and misses -- none of them were mind blowing, some down right awful.","Marina M."
"Villalobos",4,"2014-08-24","Very good! And I'm picky... Came here on a Sunday...food was fresh, seasoned perfectly and everything complimented each other. We asked for the chef and he came out to chat...definitely will be added to my Montclair dining rotation.","Michelle J."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-09-20","Had lunch here and wasn't impressed with the food. Especially for the price.  First it's a gourmet mexican which is fine but it's no Rosa Mexicano.   Chips were excellent but the first are free.  The second and more they charge. The 3 tacos I ate were decent but small.  Maybe dinner would be better. But in sum...overpriced. Save your money for Rosa's.","Charlie G."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-02-15","You know when someone tries hard to be cool, but it just ain't working? That's Villalobos. Went here last Tues night and it was crowded, which is a good thing--the NY Times review was a boon for them. But I honestly couldn't agree with the reviewer. Everything here was good (highlight was the bacon-brussels sprout guac), but not great. It seemed like someone wanted to catch up to Brooklyn 10 years ago (there was even a server with a wool cap, right out of central casting). It seemed like the decision on decor was calling up West Elm and saying, 'Come outfit our new place!' Kind of devoid of any real originality or personality--and the food reflected it. We had drinks, apps, and 3 different tacos each, so we got a fair sampling of the menu. Nothing offensive, but nothing amazing either. Options for after-dinner were the low point. No coffee, and only churros for dessert? Yeah, we weren't feeling it either. We left feeling satisfied, but not excited. That might be enough for some, but not us.","Sandy S."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-03-22","First visit a few months after opening was very good. Fresh food, tasty, good service. Second visit and food was not as good as the first time. The tacos didn't seem as fresh and tasty as the first time. It seemed like it was sitting, waiting to be recooked/re-warmed. Maybe traffic is slower on Sunday evening and things are not prepared on order? Not sure what the reason, but left a bit underwhelmed. The guacamole with bacon and brussel sprouts was a nice surprise.","Amy S."
"Villalobos",1,"2015-06-13","I LOVE tacos and authentic Mexican food.  Villalobos fell short for me.  The service was HORRIBLE.  Our waitress did not ask if we wanted drinks, so we just stayed with the tap water they gave us.  She also didn't know the specials.  We were offered a hamburger special only to be told 10 minutes later that they still didn't have the buns [it was 5:30 on a Friday night - I didn't think this was too early],  The food is so overpriced and not super fresh - one taco had peas and carrots that were definitely frozen.  If I am paying $6-8 for one taco, I want the ingredients to be at least fresh!   The kale tamales were not good at all.  There was also a hair in them, which obviously ruined my meal!  The waitress took our bill, which was over $100, and didn't offer to bring change... very rude.  I was so looking forward to this place, but was very disappointed.","Camile A."
"Villalobos",4,"2014-08-16","Checked out this place  on Friday night around 6. Sat at the bar and tried a lot of menu items, as we wanted to a large variety.  Everything seemed really authentic, and contrary to other reviews, service was great.  Water glass was filled promptly, and everyone was eager to help.   The pork belly taco was by far my favorite.  Would highly recommend it! Didn't love the pork rinds or chicken taco (little dry). Had the churro for dessert.  I was not familiar with Mexican chocolate, and found it to be a little bitter. Overall, the ambience was nice, service was good, and food all was authentic.  Like any new place with a menu different from anything else, you will probably not love everything but for sure you will find something you love.  I hope they do well!","Jason M."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-09-22","We sat at the 'bar'. The food was interesting . There was a burnt corn dish side that was actually quite good. With the Taco's they were trying too hard and they were just ok. The owner was annoying. He was working behind the bar and in your grill way too much.","Roy F."
"Villalobos",1,"2014-08-13","FOH Staff = Excellent. Probably best in town. our water glasses were refilled many times. our server checked in on us appropriately. the hostesses did not forget about us while we were waiting and notified us as the status of our table a couple of times.  First impressions - The salsa they give you is the smallest portion of salsa ever... my guess is its 1-2 tablesppons at most.    I definitely don't mind a long wait if the food is worth it (like at Sushihana) however, the food at villalobos was lack luster at best.  I ordered 3 tacos - al pastor, tinga, and camarones.  the chicken in the tinga taco tasted like it was simmered in Campbell's tomato soup and was weirdly dry.  all of the tacos were dry. perhaps if they gave you a tiny bit more salsa we could have used that to. I wont be back. Casa Piquin blows this place out of the water (even with that strange smell).","Dani D."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-03-28","Hmm, this is a tough one.  I thought I would love it, but at the end of the day it was just ok.  We tried an assortment of different things, and it's been a while so I don't remember exactly what.  I do remember some things were great and some things were bland.  The guacamole was especially bland which is confusing.  Maybe it was an off night seasoning wise, but other reviews seem to say the same thing.  I would still come back and give it a second shot.  The staff were awesome and some things were great!","Gary S."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-02-03","I give this 2 stars only because of the wait staff. The tacos are overpriced, bland, and very small. The guacamole was $10.00! For a tiny bowl like that, I would pay less than 5. For dessert, the churros were horrific. They were definitely microwaved. Overall, I think I will stick to El Matador in Bloomfield.","Rosa D."
"Villalobos",1,"2015-07-12","The food was fine.  The wait staff was fine, until it wasn't.  I just ate there with 3 other people and sat down at 5:30PM on a Sunday.  Had a perfectly serviceable time, including a dessert initiated by the waiter at 7:30PM.  At 8PM, however, the same waiter came  over to us to tell us that we were being 'kicked out' as the restaurant was closed and they  could no longer accommodate us.  NO ONE ever approached us prior, to tell us the restaurant was closing at such an early hour and they resolutely didn't care that we were not aware of this fact.  I've had other, less than savory experiences at this restaurant, but this took the level of bad service to the nth degree.  I don't fault the hapless waiter, but the mismanagement.  Shame on you.  Quite frankly.  We would have gladly left and coursed our meal accordingly, if made aware of the closing time.  But to be dismissed, unceremoniously...=bad. form.   Boo to Villalobos.  Boo.","Jill R."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-10-24","First time your fault, second time my fault. Service was good. Salsa is just a purée. Too watery and bland. Had to pay extra for guacamole which wasn't seasoned at all save for the sea urchin topping which was way too fishy! All food was cold. Fish taco was not seasoned. Chicken taco was too dry. Lengua taco languished. And who serves grapefruit virgin margaritas? Dafuq! If you're going force people to bring their own alcohol, compensate with great food!","Ibius S."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-12-29","Such a shame. I read the previous lackluster reviews but decided that we still needed to try it ourselves. Venue is great, I love that it's still close to church street strip, the open space decor is too seldom seen in montclair. But there were tons of little quirks that were surprising for a place that's been open for a little while. First off, as we were seated, we noticed that anyone who had byo'd wine, had it in a wine bucket, but ON THE FLOOR. Why wouldn't a byo already have some wine bucket stands at this point? Also, a lot of the entrees seemed served on the same size plate, small rectangular things. This was great for me and my two tacos, but my husband got a torta and it was way too small. Visually it looked cramped and with each bite he took, there was not enough plate under him to catch the fall out! I understand that they want smaller plates to not have the smaller portions swim aesthetically in negative space but still, there should be a modicum of function to form. Now, food wise, this is the real disappointment. So. Unbelieveably. Bland. I mean, no cilantro, no spice, no heat. The texture of the lengua was great, but no kick whatsoever. Everything  was oversalted.  I had to ask for lime to make my dish somewhat come to life. They have me one slice. Wtf. Texturewise however everything was on point, the tortillas were great, and the chips and guac were good also, though again that guac could have used some more flavor. For reference, we had the guac, beef torta, lengua taco and chicken taco. Would love to come here again AFTER they've ironed out their links and started using more flavor.","Emme L."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-09-29","I really want to give this place 4 or 5 stars, but the overall service was too flawed.  First, Yelp has their Sunday hours as listed as being open 'til 8...ok, no problem, we can have an earlier dinner and show up with plenty of time to be out by 8; called up to see if I needed reservations (not needed), and find out that last seating is at 7....ok, no problem.  We get in around 6:50, and are told we JUST made the last seating...wow, didn't realize it was such a strict deadline.   We are told that two of the apps are 86'd for the night, I believe the tuna and the scallops...no big deal, it is Sunday night and they're closed Mondays so they probably didn't want to have leftovers, and we weren't going to order them anyway.  We are also told that two of the tacos are out, the shrimp and another that I can't remember...ok, I was planning on ordering the shrimp but no big deal, though it is strange that they are out of so many items, especially on a smaller menu. We ordered the aguacate traditional (regular guac) and the pozole to start, and both came out in record time.  I've never had pozole before, but I would absolutely order it again...not too spicy, not too sweet, and the hominy had a nice taste.  The guac was 'eh', either a little too much lime or avocados that weren't quite fully ripened (or a combination of both) gave it a slightly sour taste...not terrible, not the greatest.  My big complaint here is the tortilla chips:  I know that the first round of chips and salsa are complimentary, and then there is a charge for more...cool, I get it, no problem....but the portion of chips is small, and just snacking on the chips and salsa before the guac came out, we ate almost all the chips.  Surprise, the guac doesn't come with chips, so now we get to eat the last few chips heaped with guac or buy another bowl of chips for $3 (but when you pay $10 for a so-so bowl of guac, you don't feel like paying more for something that should come with it).  Are they really that hard up for tortilla chips?  This annoyed me. Before apps came out we ordered our food (all tacos).  We ordered the carne asada, the roasted chicken, the pescado and the beef tongue (another first for me), 5 tacos total, and a side of rice/beans.  All were excellent, though the tortillas were kind of cold.  The only weird thing here was, again, the speed at which the food came out.   We only had a few minutes with our apps when the tacos came out...this normally wouldn't bother me, but at this point we can't help but feel rushed...it is obvious that the tacos were rushed out because of the cold tortillas, and the server seemed like she was hovering, constantly trying to hurry us along.   The second we finish our tacos and the last bit of pozole, our server swoops in to take the dishes...couldn't have finished that last little bit of fish that fell out of a taco if i wanted to, it was clear she was trying to get us out.  5 seconds later she is back with a desert menu, and 10 seconds later she is back to take our desert order, and I felt like she wanted to scream when we ordered churros...that's when I realized that it was only 7:20.  We had been in the restaurant for 25 minutes and already had apps and dinners and have ordered desert.  The other tables that were there when we walked in have long since been shoved out the door.  It is 40 minutes to closing, and we are the last ones in the place, and it is quite obvious at this point that we are the only ones keeping the staff from leaving...not a good feeling.  Server is back 3 minutes later with our churros, the check, and the rest of the 6 pack we brought (they were keeping it in the fridge for us, it is a BYO).  She may as well have lit up a huge neon sign saying 'GTFO'.  We enjoyed our churros (which were delicious btw) and were out the door by 7:30. Look, I get it, Sunday night, you're off tomorrow, last table of the day, you all want to go home, we've all been there.  DON'T rush your customers and make them feel unwelcome.  DON'T constantly remind them that they are the last people there.  DON'T send out cold tortillas in the name of leaving a minute earlier.  If you want to be out the door at 7:30, make your last seating 6:30, or just don't open on Sunday.  The so-so guac with no chips and the cold tortillas and missing 20% of your menu are really no big deal, but when you make a table feel that unwelcome, it all equates to a bad experience.","Brian F."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-08-28","I wanted to like this restaurant. In fact, I wanted to love it. The decor is spectacular. The vibe is uber-hip and super modern. Unfortunatley, that's where the buck stops. The tacos at this spot can only be described as wimpy. They lacked spice, flavor, and meat. They were flaca when they should've been gorda! Where were the freshly chopped tomatoes, bowls of onions, and dishes of salsa picante and salsa verde that are the staple of every decent taco restaurant? Where was the juice that should've been dripping from the tortilla of the carnitas taco? Where was the soul in these tacos? El espiritu? These weren't tacos, these were their skinny cousins from some other far land....what I ate last night weren't tacos....For the record, most soft shell tacos are made with two tortillas, not one. They didn't even get that detail right.  The customer service was so-so, with the owner spending more time taking pics for Instagram than talking to customers. Had her talked to us, he would've heard my girlfriend comment, 'What kind of meat is this again? It tastes like corned beef hash.' 'That's carnitas, I explained...and it's not supposed to taste like this.'  Here's my advice to the guys that run this place. Use alot more fruit and sugar for the agua fresca. Overload those little tacos with carnitas, pollo asado, camarones...let the juices and oil flow. And don't forget the queso blanco. Spend some time studying Mexican cuisine...Go the Mission in San Francisco and sample the tacos there! Spend a few weeks in East LA....or if you can't go that far, go recruit a few chefs from the Red Hook taco trucks in Brooklyn. Do something before it's too late because the hip, cute decor is great...but its not enough.","Taigi S."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-09-29","I've eaten here three times since the place opened just over a year ago and feel I've tasted quite a bit of the menu and experienced the typical service. If I was rating the food alone I'd give 3 1/2 stars - but when factoring the value, the service & attitude - they're kind of lucky to get 2 stars. Some of the food is quite good (the beet salad!) but some of it is un-even, and I can't be forgiving for the prices this place charges - their pricing is announcing 'we are a top of the line restaurant' - so any time you receive less then top of the line service or food, you'll be disappointed here - and for me that's been too often.  For instance, the home made chips were stale the last 2 times I came here, dishes come out in the wrong order, waiter was too busy cleaning to check on us when we needed something, waiter forgot something we asked for and never brought it, etc. The menu is built around their tacos - and they're small but mostly good - not mind blowing (though very inconsistent from visit to visit  -  sometimes bland, sometimes fatty or greasy). The service is a bit cool - like they're doing you un-cool people a favor - while they're making a mistake with your order.. The music provides a clue about what I think is this restaurant's problem - the three times Ive been here I'd say the average age of the customers has been early 50s - but the restaurant was blasting dance music - I think they see themselves as a destination for the hip and cool, and for people who want to pay for a 'cool' atmosphere this kind of restaurant works - but not in this kind of neighborhood (with an 50+ year old clientele) and not without a real bar.","Person P."

"Villalobos",4,"2014-08-31","We went last night and took our 2 kids (8 and 11 years old) and at first the girls weren't into this place.  They don't have a kids menu but after the great guacamole they were sold.  The decor is so NOT Mexican, but I guess that doesn't matter much.  I'm from the border of AZ and MEX so I love being around Mexican stuff as I munch, but not the case here.  It looks like a new fancy place but w/ zero Mexican flare.  The service and owner (I think) were very cool and I dug their vibe, very rock n roll looking dudes, and we are a Metal family so we like our type.  Now to the food... EXCELLENT!  I got 3 different types of Tacos (best one = carnitas!), my wife got a vege one. The kids got the Tinga chicken taco and loved it.  Our oldest got another one.  My wife and I loved the corn off the cob w/ chili and it went perfect w/ the guacamole and fresh salty chips.  This place is bring your own so we brought some ice cold Modelos and it made this meal just perfect!  We will be coming back for sure and as of right now, it's our fav Mex place in New Jersey!  Watch out!","Jose M."

Few minutes rolled by, then she goes, the table is ordering dessert, it'll be another 10 minutes.  It's been almost 40 minutes and we have been seated yet.  We left the restaurant hungry and went to another one down the street where they sat us right away.  Never again going there.","Eddie C."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-02-07","Very disappointing and way over-priced. If it was good and the service was good, I'd accept the prices. Fantastic guacamole but it was all downhill from there. If you're going to do tacos al pastor, you've gotta have cilantro and chopped onion in good proportion. They were barely present, thus not contributing to the flavor. Service was awful. Took away our food without asking and before we were done. They didn't ask if we wanted dessert.  They just brought the check. You shouldn't serve high-priced, she-shifed Mexican AND push to to turn the table before the patron is ready. We came in very excited and had a great conversation with one of the managers, then it bombed from there. Too bad.","Sean B."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-03-17","I've been multiple times and had great food each time. The tostada specials are always great with a recent one being a duck heart tostada with goat cheese. The tacos are great and my favorite is the calamari taco . You must end each meal with a churro","Nick C."

"Villalobos",2,"2015-02-28","Our first dining trip in November was good. The room hummed, food and service were satisfying enough, so we went back yesterday, to a room at 6pm that was empty. So i am wondering if other folks on their second trip had a similar experience to ours last night. The food was either under-seasoned and bland (short rib) or over-seasoned (the interesting  and promising corn app). The scallop taco special was nothing special, somewhat dry and uninspired; the pork belly was nothing ho-hum, too. My wife's taco drew no raves and was served cooler than the norm. Hoping this was an anomaly. Maybe it was simply a slow start to what ended up a busy night. Fingers crossed for them. I do like their idea and the room, when going, is a nice scene.","N T."

The chef has a great interpretation of traditional Mexican dishes with flare,  creatively updating the menu to hit seasonal flavors.

"Villalobos",2,"2014-11-27","won't be back...gave this place a second chance hoping they needed to get things worked out since they were only open a few weeks and wanted to like it so much as the décor is great and Montclair could use an upscale Mexican place. First, the service...they seemed so enthusiastic but when you tell me - twice - you are going to bring me a new plate and then don't, I kind of feel that you were being insincere.  The food, the traditional guac was  a bit brighter and more plentiful the first time...the second time I ate there..not so much. The tacos..I had the al pastor and the pork belly one both times. With my second visit, both were much much drier. The corn off the cob was the HIGHLIGHT...very good with a bit of a kick. From the crudo menu, we had the ceviche (PS why they label the course as crudo when it's not is a bit suprising...) which was way too citrusy...couldn't enjoy it.  We had the chicken wings...bland is the best I can say about those...and finally, the churros...they looked delectable but undercooked inside. Oh, the chips are real tasty as is the green 'salsa' that is brought out.  At the end of the day, it's about the food and service...not much here to make me come back...","Michele P."
"Villalobos",4,"2017-01-18","The positives: This was my first time at Villalobos. The ambiance is great; the lighting is a little dim, which I prefer because it gives more of a 'night out' feel. The menu is small, but I prefer that as well because too many options can be overwhelming. There was a good selection of food--multiple taco options including beer battered cod, shrimp, pork belly, chicken, brisket, beef tongue, and a vegetarian option...pretty much whatever you're craving can be satisfied with a taco. They had a ton of different little salsa bowls to try, which were all creative and delicious. I went with the pescado taco (fish) and the carnitas taco (pork). Both tacos were delicious. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and very tentative. Finally, the churros were to die for. I've had quite a few churros in my life and these might be the best ever.  The negatives: There aren't too many negatives. One thing I will say is there was a bit of fat on the pieces of pork, which I had to slice off, but overall the flavor was excellent (I recommend drizzling some of the honey-chipotle salsa on it!). The next thing is the price. Some people complain about the price because the tacos are so small, and yes, they were quite small ($6 per taco), but they were stuffed with as much as they could comfortably fit. If you're not on a strict budget, the price won't be much of a problem. And if you are on a tight budget, it's only $12 for two small-but-stuffed tacos which are plenty filling.  Overall, I only give this place four stars (really a 4.5 though) because of the grizzle on the pork. The price was a tad high, but worth it for a special treat. Everything else was impeccable!","Nancy M."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-04-06","I ate dinner at Villalobos tonight which was my first experience here.  The space is nicely decorated. Service was prompt and staff was friendly. Prices were a little high for what you get but the quality of food is very good. As an appetizer we ordered the peanut and pumpkinseed guacamole with chips. Quite tasty and I highly recommend.  Tacos are small and six bucks a piece. I ordered three which I think was a sufficient meal. I had the Carne Asada, Pescado Frito, and Camarones. All three tacos were tasty especially the Pescado and Camarones. All tortillas are made on site.  I would definitely come back!","John C."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-03-26","Tacos where amazing. Definitely fresh and authentic. Our server Taylor was very courteous young man who made sure that we enjoyed our dinning experience. I orders the skirt steak and they where delicious, very flavorful along with the shrimp tacos that where just as good. We also ordered the bacon and brussel guacamole. It was eh ok the brussel sprouts are served brunt and it really made the whole dish taste burnt and the guacamole I'll just say it wasn't the best. However the tacos where amazing and our overall experience was great. Would suggest, will return.","Jan B."
"Villalobos",3,"2017-01-13","Love the ambiance in this place. We ordered the guacamole flight and each had two tacos. My tacos were delicious - brisket and pork belly.  My only problem is (maybe I shouldn't go to Mexican places?) that I hate cilantro. Only one of the guacamoles had a description that listed it. I asked the waiter if they could leave it off. He says sure. Delivers the guacamole flight...and ALL of them have cilantro in them.  I point it out to him and he just kind of shrugged and said well yeah they always do.  Wouldn't you tell me that when I asked you to please leave it off? He didn't even apologize or ask if we wanted something else instead.  If not for that, I'd probably give the place 4 stars. Just be warned if you think cilantro tastes like soap!","Caitlin G."
"Villalobos",4,"2017-01-02","Fun place for some tacos - you get to try different ones and prices are pretty reasonable. Only thing is it's not a lot of food, so order more if you are hungry. The food that is included though is very tasty, and the ambiance of the place is nice, so it's worth the trip!","Vera L."
"Villalobos",3,"2016-01-11","$6 per taco?! Do they have truffles, foie gras and gold flakes in there?  I wasn't going to get any, but since my cousins each got one, I had to bite. Should have stuck with my gut feeling. I tried the scallop taco with brussel sprouts. Lacked flavor and bite. It's a $3 taco.  Flavorwise, I'll take an authentic Mexican $1.50 taco over this. As for the rest of the food - it's actually quite good. The bacon and brussel sprout guacamole has probably the smokiest bacon I've ever had (including my own. mental note: throw more wood chunks onto the charcoals). It was quite the experience. The chilaquiles had really good heat. It was also only $5 (albeit with no meat). Still a pretty good deal.  The space is beautiful. Very clean, open and filled with New York Rangers memorabilia and staff wearing Villalobos shirts designed with the diagonal Rangers jersey design. Service was great. Very nice people. Everything was taken care of in a timely fashion. If they slash their taco prices, then this place easily becomes a 4. Edit: I almost forgot about the Masa fried chicken. The Masa was not crunchy at all and lacked flavor. They seriously need to rework this recipe. Leave it off the menu in the meantime.","Neal N."
"Villalobos",3,"2017-02-06","Good quality food but way too overpriced for the portion size. Came for lunch with a party of 3. $65 later - still hungry.","Spencer M."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-02-11","What a pleasant surprise. We went there after seeing their old menu online. When we sat down the place was empty, the menu changed and was more limiting, we thought what did we get into... boy one time I'm glad first impression were so wrong. This place was fantastic. After trying the appetizers I decided I wanted everything on the menu. The food was fantastic as was the service, each server that walked by asked how everything was, very attentive and very knowledgeable. By the time our mains arrived there wasn't and empty seat available. The salsas were great too, literally my only complaint was the cost of the salsas for the amount they gave us but they were excellent. A must try is the Bacon and Brussel Sprout guacamole,  so much better then I could have imagined! Dessert was homemade Mexican churros,yum! This is a great pre theater treat! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.","Melissa T."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-09-10","SOOOOOO, since my boyfriend really loves this place and I've since grown to love it as well, I would like to retract my highly negative and critical review of Villalobos. SO NOW, I would like to re-review and RAVE about how much I love Villalobos. The portion sizes have increased and everything is still incredible. Try their guacamole...ALL flavors are a bomb of awesomeness in your mouth. The meats in the tacos are tender, full of flavor that doesn't overwhelm and their churros are that exact metaphorical cherry on top. Villalobos now...or forever regret it when you go elsewhere for Mexican.","Diana M."
"Villalobos",1,"2016-11-03","This restaurant and owner is disrespectful of its customers. We had a reservation, and upon arriving were told that they had a party and could not honor our reservation. Instead of apologizing, the owner yelled at us and basically chased us out of the restaurant. We have never in our lives felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant.  Obviously, we will never return and will share our disgust at this owner's behavior with everyone we know. IN RESPONSE TO OWNERS MESSAGE: Unbelievably, this owner has decided to dig himself a deeper hole in order to try to clear his name. Our reservation was most certainly taken for 7 PM that evening. If he has incompetent, misinformed people working for him, that does not allow him to blame their mistakes on the customers. He most certainly treated us as depicted in my original review.  Instead of simply apologizing and admitting that he was having a busy or rough evening, he has now compounded his error and made us even angrier about how he treated us. He appears to be a defensive, angry individual, and I don't know about you, but I would never eat food produced in the kitchen of a liar who does not like his customers!","Susan L."
"Villalobos",3,"2016-01-03","The food was good, but overpriced. I live in Manhattan and am relatively accustomed to overpriced tacos, but I thought $5-7 for a single (very small) taco in suburban NJ was a bit steep. I ordered three tacos and still left feeling like I could've eaten more food. That being said, the veggie taco was the standout in my opinion while the scallop taco disappointed.","Kirsten H."
"Villalobos",3,"2016-09-20","The atmosphere of this restaurant is really nice. I like how the kitchen is open, the decor, and the tables were comfortable to sit at. We had really great service, and our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. If I had to give the overall food a rating, it would definitely be a 2.  We started with the Brussels sprouts and bacon guac. The chips were fresh and perfectly salted and the guac is probably the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot...) I'll definitely be craving it. For dinner, I got a scallop taco (the special), a carne Asada taco, and a shrimp taco. The scallop taco was pretty pathetic. It contained one whole scallop, cut in half and it was on a bed of roasted Brussels sprout leaves... and that's it. Didn't taste that great. The carne asada was OKAY. It was definitely over-salted, and the meat was tough. I really liked the shrimp taco though- they were fried and in a really good sauce. I should've just ordered three shrimp tacos! Hah.  I really wish they had more to offer on their menu than just tacos because I really wanted to like this place. I probably won't go back because it's pretty expensive and the portions aren't that big. Disappointing.","Em G."
"Villalobos",2,"2016-06-19","Interesting menu, but this is not a traditional Mexican place. They do their own thing which is fine sometimes, but not when you just want tacos, chips, etc Also, they were not very customer oriented.","Jeff P."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-05-07","Walking into the restaurant, at 4:45pm, on Cinco De Mayo, i was surprised how empty the place was.  I assumed it would fill up as the evening went on.  I am also sure this had something to do with the fact that the restaurant does not serve alcohol (not much of a happy hour). Anyway, i was the first one there, and we had a reservation at 5pm, for 5 people.  Literally only one table was seated, and no wait.  I asked if i could sit at the table, and was told no.. had to wait for the rest of my party. I understand that if the place is busy, but when it's empty... oh well.  Waited a little bit, and then 2 other people from our group filtered in... 10-15 mins later, they allowed us to sit.  there seemed to be 2 tables set up for 5 people.  One was at the very front and the other at the very back.  they were walking us to the back, so we asked if we could at the front table.  Again, the hostess said no, and something about having arranged the seating in a specific way, and that they could not change it. within a few mins, our entire party was there.  They brought over some chips, and also a few different sauces.  Chips were nice, and sauces were good.  I asked for a hot sauce, which was very mild for me. We ordered some appetizers - Octopus ceviche, tuna tar tar, tamal, etc.  Octopus was my favorite out of all of them, which i was surprised about.  I usually am a big fan of tuna tar tar.  This was good, but just didn't have the citrus, salt, heat that i was looking for.  flavors were extremely mild.  This was unfortunately also true for the main course. I ordered the scallop taco, and the fish taco.  Both were very bland, and didn't have much to them.  It wasn't bad, but it just didn't have that kick i was looking for. We had also ordered a few sides to share.  Nacho cheese (which i thought was cheese, and not nacho's with cheese), and the potatoes. Our waitress was great for most of the evening, and very patient with us as we were relaxing and enjoying our dinner.  Unfortunately, at some point, we were told that they needed the table for another party that literally had walked in 3-4 mins before. We had been dismissed.  If you are looking for good, mexican food, i would probably try else where.","Asish P."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-08-29","Very yummy. Great portions. I was hungry when I went and I ended up sharing the Bacon and Brussels Guacamole (less dramatic than you'd think, recommended) and ordering three tacos. I wasn't stuffed when I left the Villalobos, but I was full. I went on a Sunday night with a friend around 6:30 and it was a perfect time to go. Also the setting was very interesting (you can watch the chefs work in the open kitchen) and the tables were cute as well! Recommended and no complaints.","Stephanie W."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-11-05","Ahh, drooling thinking about their tacos. Unique flavor combos that you don't get anywhere else, local at least. I don't eat meat and there's still plenty to pick from. The gauc combos are also delish... guac with crab? Yes please.  Nice decor. Unless downside is that it can be hard to get a table without a reservation.","Amanda T."
"Villalobos",1,"2016-10-13","went here after seeing cuban pete had a 1 hr  wait.  Walking in i thought wow this looks like a nice place. looked at the menu and was disappointed. i ordered the carne asada it was tasteless my boyfriend's tacos were so tiny! this place is overpriced for no reason. the only thing that was good was our churros.","Sofia S."

"Villalobos",5,"2016-05-16","Damn Daniel, not only are your white vans quite something but how bout them lil tacos from Villalobos!!?!?!? Yeah, they were that good! Here's the deal with Villalobos from my overly self-important and moderately accurate review. You will over pay for your meal by 20%, no question. But....it'll be DAMN GOOD!!!  Innovative Mexican cuisine, super fresh ingredients and an execution with the precision focus and laconic swiftness of a fine Swiss watch. We sat at the bar which allowed us to observe the kitchen staff and it was impressive. No one talked, everyone on on the line had a job and was solely focused on their individual role. The result was a drama free line with perfect execution and no drama.  The flavors were wonderful. We had between the two of us 5 different tacos; Steak, Chicken, Fish, Scallop. Where do I begin? The small corn tortilla was creamy, grainy, and soft. The chicken taco was deep hearty smoky and adorned with potato chips, boom! The fish taco delish...nuff said and the steak taco was quite literally the finest flavors I've enjoyed in months and months.They also had an interesting corn appetizer which was tossed in the most uniquely flavored dressing I've ever enjoyed. However, that dish was $11.00 and was basically half a cup of corn with an interesting sauce. Gotta figure this dish cost them about $0.65 to actually make.  Final take away is that the food is outstanding and the service/execution was perfect but you're gonna pay for it. These little tacos are $6.00 per and you need at least 3 to feel as if you've had a full meal...but you're also going to want to enjoy an app too so the truth is before you know it you're at $25 - $30 per person with out any drinks so you walk out licking your lips but wondering what the hell happened to your wallet.","Dan G."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-09-29","Great ambiance and friendly service greeted us as we walked in to Villalobos. We got the heads up to BYOB - they were very accommodating as we're unused to this custom in Montclair. The menu looked great with lots of vegetarian and creative options. The food, unfortunately, disappointed though. The special salad was warm kale with pinto beans and just didn't work out. The vegetarian enchiladas were bland and uninteresting. The chilaquiles side missed the mark without any noticeable eggs on top - the key ingredient! But the guacamole was good though! If they tighten up on taste they'll be great. They've got the bones for it.","Ben S."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-10-12","The food was very good. The bacon wrapped appetizer was so delicious. The guacamole was great. Basically everything we had was delicious. Yes it is loud but we didn't mind. It's BYOB also!!!","Jay B."
"Villalobos",1,"2016-01-27","Uh... I'm $23.54 poorer and I have no good explanation as to why. I hate leaving bad reviews but we will start with the good: the ambience is beautiful. BYOB. Amazing guac. My waiter was very nice and extremely attentive. The bad: Everything else! The taco is no bigger then the palm of your hand and it's $6 for each one. The fish taco has NO FLAVOR. The shrimp taco was very flavorful but it fell apart because of the corn tortilla. The corn tortilla isn't even good. Not to mention I'm still hungry.","Tora L."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-11-05","Excellent, modern take on taqueria. Menu is limited, but pretty much everything is executed very well.  Bacon/Brussels guac was solid, carne asada taco was excellent, fish taco was out of this world. Churros were the perfect cap on a quick and satisfying meal. Shrimp taco was solid, but should have ordered two fish instead.  Service was very attentive. Guy who fills the water for you made sure the heat from the tinga and carne asada tacos never made me miss the lack of margaritas.  Management needs to get a liquor license, and this place would be perfect!","Brent D."
"Villalobos",2,"2016-01-10","As a big fan of Mexican, I was excited to try this place but was a big let down. I'll start with the food and the very limited menu. We started with guac and chips. The guac was yummy and I thought great can't wait for the rest of the meal. My whole party ordered tacos, they range between 6 and 7 bucks a piece. I ordered 3.  The best outta the 3 was the carnitas. The fish taco was good but just missing something. The shredded pork taco was so salty, I mean like inedible salty. We did address it with the waitress and two of my friends who had only ordered those were able to get new ones without the heavy handed sea salt they put on them. The waitress seemed annoyed when we addressed it. The tacos do not come with any sides and are small. Some were more filling than others. In the middle of us eating dinner the waitress asked if we thought we'd want to order desert. Our answer was simply maybe but we are still eating. She stated though the kitchen was closing. It was 10:30 and they close at 11. Nothing like rushing your customers out the door. Another problem I saw was the fact that people still were eating when they decided to mop the floor around them. Yuck!!  It does have a good atmosphere so maybe if they revamp the staff, add some more menu items, this place may have some potential. Too many other great restaurants in town though to waste your time or money here.","Michele D."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-03-24","You had me at guacamole with bacon and Brussels sprouts!  This lovely space with open kitchen has great guacamole and salads to share . Their small street size tacos are a little pricey at $6-7, but man, are they delish! My special taco of the day with Grilled scallops was fantastic. Fish taco had slaw and mayo sauce, but was nothing special. Lots  of pork, beef, even a veggie taco. Without an app you'd need to eat 3 or 4 tacos to feel full.  Churros for dessert came with a hot chocolate sauce to dip them in.  Service was good, but no hot beverages offered here. I asked for coffee  or tea with dessert. Nada!  Will come back to this Byob again, but guys you need to add teas and coffees, please!","Lisa S."
"Villalobos",2,"2016-01-11","Nice environment but the food is subpar. Tacos were too salty, very small, and lacked flavor. Not impressed with our waitress either. She left mid dinner and we got someone else. No idea why, but she was still there. It was hard to find something I wanted to order so look at the menu before you go.","Jill P."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-09-19","The crab guac was delicious but you have to like crab - there were decent sized chunks in there. I happen to like it so I really enjoyed it got the scallop taco and brisket taco - those were both very flavorful and not too filling - just right. best for last...BYO. looks like a nice spot for date night or just a low-key dinner with a friend.","Punam P."
"Villalobos",2,"2017-01-08","Came here on a Friday night.  It wasn't crowded to my initial surprise.  Now I understand why.  Had a flight of guacamole and got 4 small portions and a small bucket of chips (for our party of 4 people).  The guacamole was good.  Brussel sprouts and bacon were a fav.  Took a long time to get a second bucket of chips and we were almost done eating it before our dinner order was even taken...again, it was not busy.  We all ordered tacos at $6 per taco.  They were decent as far as taste, but again VERY small.  I actually left hungry after spending almost $30 per person.  I had to eat again later when I got home.  I am only giving 2 stars because the food was tasty.  Otherwise, it would be only 1 star.  I won't be going back.","Stephanie S."
"Villalobos",1,"2016-07-04","Honestly I don't even know where to begin let's start with the service... Place was half empty and the service was lackluster. We ordered some salsas, guacamole  and chips and six different types of tacos. The guacamole and chips came out first and the tacos after we were finished I mentioned that the salsas we ordered never came out, but just then the waitress shuffles over our three salsas and  dumps them on the table and says under her breath, 'the runner should've brought these out.' The tacos were over seasoned and an all-around disappointing. Won't go back and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Update- I do believe if I indeed had a worst enemy, they would at least have taste buds. Watching 3 guys in the weeds, with the place more than half empty was entertaining, I'll give you that.  But truly, perhaps you should check what you're putting out by actually tasting it. You would have found it dry, over cooked, and over seasoned.  -Sue","Sue C."
"Villalobos",2,"2016-10-19","Don't waste your time. So went here on a friday night for dinner, made reservations ahead of time. Started with Guac (was meh) and corn (delicious!). We placed our orders for our meals and sat there chatting. About 40 minutes passes by and we notice tables around us get seated and their food all within this time. Mind you, no one has come by our table since we placed our order to check in on us. We finally turn around to get our waitresses attention and she gestures and mouthes that our food is on its way. Another 10-15 minutes passes and nothing so we get the attention of the manager who says he'll take a look into it. During this waiting time my friend gets up to go to the counter and the waitress comes to the table and states 'she didn't need to get up to go to the counter' very rudely.  Mistakes happen and she probably just forget to clock our order in but had she kept us in the loop and let us know, it would've been fine. Instead she proceeded to get defensive and treat us very poorly. As if this wasn't enough, I could see her talking about us to the other wait staff the entire time following the incident - constantly looking over at us with her coworkers making it very uncomfortable for us to finish out meal.  The 2 stars are for the manager who was polite and able to resolve the problem professionally and for the delicious shrimp taco!","Nisha P."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-10-16","Went to Villalobos last night and it was great. I had the carne asada and camorones tacos and my date had two chicken and chorizo tinga tacos. We also ordered esquites. Everything was fantastic and we would certainly eat here again.  The staff was friendly and their menu recommendations proved spot on.  Some people are complaining about the serving sizes, but I don't know what they were expecting. I thought the sizes of the tacos were normal. But then again I didn't have expectations that they would be anything larger than normal tacos.  On a side note, it was a little disappointing that they ran out of beef tongue so early into the night.","Todd O."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-08-18","(3.5 at most) I had high hopes for Villalobos, and for months had anxiously waited for the grand opening of this restaurant ever since a Mexican flag was hung in their window. But sadly, my first visit was just slightly under my 'impressed' line.  My boyfriend and I came here for dinner just before 6pm last Thursday night and were immediately seated without reservations. The hostess said we had the option to seat at the bar, but who was she kidding (it's not like the place was expecting a full house a few days after opening). We politely said no, and  were directed to seat a two-seater table along the main tufted booth wall. Menus were given and shortly approached by a bus boy or runner who provided us waters. FRESH CHIPS and two kinds of SALSA were brought over by a bus boy too. The menu was overall small with variety, and prices were wallet friendly. We were both looking to order a few things here and there from the menu to get an overall sense of the food, and decided on the Villalobos from the Crudos section, Esquites from the Antojitos (or 'Little Cravings') section, and five different tacos from the Tacos section. (Heck, if you're going to have a tacos section, they better be worth my while). To drink I had started on the PRICKLY PEAR & MINT AGUA FRESCA. For $2 the price was quite marketable, but sadly had no mint flavor. The pear flavor was faint, but still present. They could have just added had a mint leaf in my glass and it would have done wonders for my drink. Our food came out in a timely manner. The VILLALOBOS which consisted of uni, guac and tomatillos was very fresh, but I wish there was some spice to cut through the richness of the guac, and served with more chips or some chips of some sort. (How was I supposed to eat it all?) The ESQUITES or corn salad had some serious ancho chili powder kick, but I kind of wish there was less of it to bring out the grilled corn flavor (there was grill marked on my corn). Out of the all of the tacos we had ordered, here's how I would rank them: 1. CAMARONES (the most cohesive out of the bunch, well balanced flavor) 2. VERDURAS 3. PESCADO (this would have been in 2nd place but the fish was too small) 4. CARNITAS  5. BARBACOA (I did not like how the meat was diced, it was just falling out of the taco as I was eating it) In between all of the food I had also ordered the CANTALOUPE agua fresca which was sub par of the PRICKLY PEAR. Lastly of course had to order the only dessert on the menu: CHURROS. From what we were told it would have came with 3 PIECES covered in sugar and cinnamon and chocolate for dipping. What did we get? One long churro and one short churro, poorly piped into the oil for frying, extra crunchy on the outside, super doughy on the inside with more sugar than cinnamon on the exterior. Let's just put it this way, Costco makes better churros!  Overall the service was great but minor faulty, the food was very fresh and seasoned well, but had no integrity, a little too gourmet, and overly panache if you asked me. They're selling themselves the right way, but the food was lacking soul. I maybe a little tough on personal preference but that's pretty much the selling point between me visiting here again and me visiting other Mexican places in the next town over that'll serve my wallet a little more justice with slightly more better value. Constructive criticism for management: 1. The bus boys need to be a little less timid. Tell me what kind of salsa you're putting in front of me, say excuse me when you refill my water glass. BE CONFIDENT, BE PRESENT, you're part of the restaurant too. 2. The choice of plates were not functional for me. Esquites on a platter? I saw the table next to me with a side of heaping rice in an 'chinese buffet ice cream' glass cup??! Wishlist:  I was disappointed to find out that little ol' Arnold Palmer was behind the counter; it looked like Horchata. Horchata would have been a very nice drink option.","Jennifer M."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-10-01","Simple, cute, and clean interior. Fast service. Flavorful food. BYOB. The guacamole was very good.  I really enjoyed the al pastor de pollo taco. I also had a bistec de res taco which had good flavor but my piece of meat was just a little too fatty.   The only dessert option is Churros, to me they were nothing to rave about, they should offer a caramel sauce too instead of just chocolate sauce.","Victoria B."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-05-09","Villalobos, as in Jorge Villalobos. 'Yo soy tu papá.' (I only expect those of you who have seen Meet the Fockers to understand that). Jason V. and I went here on Cinco de Mayo, and ay caramba! What a disaster! How this place was so clearly understaffed for the most widely celebrated no-such-Mexican-holiday in the United States is beyond me. They were probably at 60% capacity by the time we rolled in around 8:30 so we sat at the bar, feeling no need to be all intimate at a table. It must have taken 20 minutes for someone to take our order, but the person who finally did start to at least serve us water and open our wine was the hostess who sat us. Bottom line: the prices here are outrageous in proportion to the serving sizes. I get that they're probably getting creamed on the rent given the location, but $26 for the what is undoubtedly the smallest portion of cochinita pibil I've ever been served? En serio? I left con hambre. At least it was tasty, but what's the deal with the side of chipotle mayo? The pork sure didn't need it. Was it meant for the dry rice and beans? Jason V. was happy with his tacos, but he had to get 3 at almost $20 total just to make a meal out of it. On a positive note, I do like the space. It's very clean, but is sadly lacking that authentic Mexican feel to it. They need more decor to set the mood.  BYOB, but don't bring wine or tequila thinking they have the mixers for sangria or margaritas. But hey, at least they have Coke in the bottle!","Adam D."

The waiter was a golden god. Yes you with the glasses. He came right up and was great. He suggested the tomato salad just to get us warmed up and he was right.    The sweet pea and bacon guacamole was incredible. Get it and spread all over everything.    Tacos. Tacos. Tacos. I loved the shrimp and brisket.  Hold on ill be back   But wait midway through the meal I hear the house music. It is a loud place. So I could only make out the bass but it was Come Together the Aerosmith version. Then Black Sabbath kicks in. All hail the DJ.    The dessert was awesome.mango pepper Popsicles. Churros. Yum.    Go here and eat the greatness.","Adam M."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-08-30","Love love love this place! First of all, it just looks cool from the outside. The food did not disappoint at all - the Chilaquiles app is fantastic. I would honestly think of it as dressed-up nachos, sooooo good. I tried the carne asade, chicken & chorizo, & shrimp tacos - all very good, but the shrimp was definitely my favorite. If you're looking for a trendy taco place definitely check this place out!","Ludovica A."
"Villalobos",3,"2016-08-27","Tacos are pretty good! Love the aesthetic and set up of the place. Was definitely expecting bigger tacos for the price, but overall not bad.","Stephanie R."
"Villalobos",1,"2016-05-03","Pros: The restaurants decor was lovely, had a dimmed romantic feeling to it. Also, the staff was very friendly. Cons, Cons and Cons:  1.I found this place through yelp last Saturday night, and when i had to be directed to the website to make a reservation it gave me selection times to choose from. Those times extended to 11:30 pm on their website. I walked in at about 10:15 and the waitress said we only had 5 minutes to order until they closed the kitchen. I found that odd, why would you even let your customers make reservations until 11:30 if you weren't planning on serving them? 2.I have absolutely no idea why this place is categorized as 'Mexican'. This hipster joint had about 5 appetizers, about 6 different tacos to choose from and 3 salsas that you had to pay extra for. NO burritos, chalupas, chimichangas, huaraches, quesadillas, taquitos or fajitas.  3. I don't agree with this place being categorized as 'moderately' priced ( $$ ). The appetizers ranged from $7-$11 but its PER person, no sharing when it comes to these orders, tiny tiny portions.  I also ordered a taco which was $6, but again because of the size (HONESTLY SMALLER THAN MY PALM) you would need 4 of these tacos to be considered a decent meal. So including the app and 4 tacos your total (PER PERSON) would be about $31, not including the tip of course. 4. I wouldn't even mind paying $6 for a micro taco if the taste was SUPERB but it severely lacked in flavor. I ordered the chicken taco, it was dry. The order of nachos i received had practically nothing on them ( because remember salsa is extra) and tasted like cardboard. I didn't even finish it. Needless to say I went home afterwards and had an ENTIRE meal.","Mare E."
"Villalobos",5,"2017-01-30","I was very impressed with my first visit here. Went to lunch on a Sunday which was nice because I imagine that it gets crazy crowded at night. We were one of a few tables so we had a leisurely lunch with good service. The waitress was well informed and not too bothersome. She gave us time to decide and gave her 2 cents on recommendations. We started off with a trio of salsas which were a bit spicy but each had their own distinct flavor. This was a nice change to the standard salsa at most Mexican restaurants. We also got the guac with bacon and brussels. This was good as well. The bacon was thick and chunky but not fatty. I liked the spin on it. We tried the duck appetizer which was ok. I don't think I'm a huge fan of mole so it wasn't my fave but if you like duck and mole, def try it. We each got 2 tacos - we weren't really sure how many to get but I have to say with salsa, quac, chips, an app and 2 tacos I was happily full. I prob could have eaten 3 tacos but would have been uncomfortable after that. We each got the carnitas taco and the shrimp taco .They were both really delicious and I added some of the salsa to the carnitas. The tomatoes on the shrimp taco were fresh and super tasty but I think they may have added too much liquid and by the time I ate it, the taco was falling apart. Keep in mind the tortillas are freshly made too. I can't wait to go back again. Other than El Matador which is more like grandma's homemade mexican - different take than this - I would say this would be my choice for Mexican in this area.","Natalie W."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-01-08","I was extremely surprised how popular this place is. It was insanely packed on a Monday night, so despite our reservation, we were forced to wait a bit. I was expecting some really exotic stuff on their menu per the old reviews I've read but I walked out of Villalobos a bit disappointed. The only thing that was close to being exotic was the lengua tacos, though in fairness, it turned out to be amazingly delicious.  I tried about 5 tacos: Lengua, Grilled Scallops,  Al Pastor, Pescado Frito Carnitas. What really stood out are the Lengua and Grilled Scallops so I highly recommend those two. For appetizers, we had the bacon/brussels guacomale and octupis ceviche. The guacamole was quite unique so I would recommend that as well. It's not a bad pick for dinner. The restaurant has a casual/modern interior and has a pretty good, personable, and attentive team to provide great service. And also, the food IS extremely affordable which by itself upgrade my grade to a 4.","Nin A."
"Villalobos",3,"2016-07-13","It's ok. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. The food is really pricey and a little under seasoned. It also takes about 20-30 mins for your food to arrive. This is a long time to wait for tacos.","Maricia H."
"Villalobos",1,"2016-04-30","The service was horrendous! There were other people that came in after us that got food before us. The food was bland and extremely over priced and had to constantly remind the waiter to bring out our 10$ guacamole before the main course. We were in there for way to long and each taco is 6$ but only worth 2 $ with no taste. Have been to other Mexican restaurants with better service and more reasonable prices. Would not recommend to anyone!","Katerina D."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-07-25","I was very excited to find this place. The decor is very nice ( thank you for not putting up mariachi hats and blankets ) even though the chairs are uncomfortable. The food is very good and fresh, many of the tacos and sides were flavored very similar to authentic Mexican tacos, the cook knows Mexican food. The service was friendly but a bit confused. We will be back soon !","Lucas M."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-07-21","We have been going to Villalobos since they opened and the food is AMAZING! The tacos are delicious and very authentic (my fiancé lived in Mexico and said these are the best he has ever had). The guacamole is awesome too and let's not forget about the home made tortilla chips and different variety of salsa's.  The prices are very good and you will leave there full.  My personal favorites are any of the fish tacos.  It is also BYOB so you can bring a bottle of wine or they have yummy margarita mixes (lemon lime is our fave) and bring some tequila to mix in! The staff are friendly and the decor in the restaurant is charming (we always sit at the bar which we love).  Lastly the chef is really nice and always greets us and remembers us every time we come in...even when we haven't been there in a while. Would definitely recommend this place if you want authentic Mexican food!","Jamie M."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-10-05","I had a very positive experience at Villalobos. Two friends and I came here on a Friday night and it was packed (Tip #1 make a reservation or come early). So, we wound up sitting at the bar (no they don't serve drinks - its BYOB tip #2) which faces the open kitchen. The decor is rustic modern and was well put together. We tried the traditional guacamole and the tuna tostada as appetizers. The guacamole was fresh and tasted good, but was nothing too special. The tuna tostada, however, was very good! Fresh raw tuna mixed with watermelon and lime served on a tostada chip. Very Delicious - highly recommend. For the main course, they offer a few traditional dishes, but have a decent taco menu. We all ordered a variety of tacos. All were very good. There are about 10 to choose from (pork, chicken, beef, fish, shrimp, etc.) and each range from $6 to $10 each. I chose a pork and fish taco - tasty and flavorful. We also ordered the asparagus and the papas brava sides and I have to say both were FANTASTIC (see the pictures).  I am a light eater and 2 tacos and a side were good enough, but would probably recommend 3 tacos for most people.  This place takes Mexican dining to a different level! I will definitely be returning!","Kurt H."
"Villalobos",1,"2015-09-08","The best word to describe Villalobos is elementary. I recently had given them a second try.  I'd been there once after it opened - food was good but the service was very poor.  I'd figured they were still trying to get their bearing, which is understandable.  So, a year later, we'd had a reservation for 2 at 7 on a weeknight and I was so looking forward to the creamy corn and scallop tacos.  We walk in and it wasn't crowded, but we were seated next to 2 rather loud woman.  I asked to move over 1 table and it was like I asked the chef/owner to donate his kidney.  He stood in the open kitchen shaking his head, making faces and mumbling.  We left and will not ever return. I don't understand the bad behavior.  It's such a nice space that you have and the food is apparently good.","Kristi R."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-08-06","I love this place. The decor is sleek and minimalist yet fun and sitting at the bar is fun if you are in the mood! The tacos and guacamole (the peanut and pumpkin seeds guac is quite delicious) are really delicious and innovative. The Pescado Frito and the Verduras tacos are my absolute favorites, so fresh and every bite is a perfected tasty morsel. Highly recommend!","Jess M."
"Villalobos",4,"2016-07-07","First time coming here and the crab guacamole was so fresh and delicious! Also had the steak taco and shrimp taco--yes they're tiny, but it was perfect for lunch, and they tasted quite great! Many reviews complain about the price, but you're in the heart of Montclair, and there's attention to detail. If you want more, I suggest going to a taco truck or a different town. This is not your typical taco place and they have a very unique combination of flavors, but they compliment each other well. It's BYOB, so that's always a plus.  The service however, was the worst part. We came for lunch and we were the third table (no additional one showed during our time there). However, the server seemed weeded and flustered, perhaps because he spent time on the phone. Not very personable--he tried the 'yeah I'm cool and laid back attitude' but it was rather arrogant. Brought us the wrong bill at the end, and when he did bring it, didn't even say anything, just literally dropped the mini clipboard clanking onto the table. Talk about rude.  I teetered between 3 & 4 stars, but ultimately chose 4 because the food was fresh and very good.","Ashley E."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-01-30","I left Villalobos underwhelmed and with a hearty feeling of 'meh.'  I was excited to try a new Mexican restaurant in Montclair but really, this place is nothing to write home about. The inside decor is trying so hard to be trendy.  Why bother?  You are a Mexican restaurant.  Serve me some delicious Mexican food!  Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the food.  The chips and salsa that came out were decent.  The chips were nice and sturdy and had a good flavor.  It's probably just me, but I would have liked just a regular salsa roja for my chips to go along with their 'fancier' salsas. I ordered 3 tacos (Verduras, Pescado, and Carnitas) plus the rice and beans.  The only taco that really had any flavor was the Verduras and it was SPICY!  My mouth was burning!  The beer battered fish was boring and about as bland as could be.  The pork belly was dry!  At one point I had to take a gulp of wine to get my bite down.  Even the rice and beans lacked flavor and was served in what looked to be a rice pudding glass.  Sure.  Why not. The host and server were attentive which was nice, and the bus boys kept our table clean and our water glasses full.  Overall though, I was not impressed.  I think I will just stick to my favorite Mexican spot in Montclair, Casa Piquin.","Jessi S."

"Villalobos",1,"2015-09-05","WARNING!  Poor Service - Yuck Factor - Subpar Food - Annoying Ambiance ...but this is just our opinion, we could be wrong... POOR SERVICE Drink options? No mention of drink options by waiter, 'B'; when I asked, he said,  'oh we do it verbally because we used to offer a drink menu but no one looked at it' --yet, he failed to mention drinks until we finally asked after appetizers! Insult to injury, our only drinks, water glasses, were left empty for over 10 minutes, prompting the drink question. YUCK FACTOR!  Um, this waiter kept pinch-rubbing his nose, and that was before he brought our plates, GROSS! SUBPAR FOODS: The tortilla chips were forgotten when our guac was delivered, and the ones that came were (getting?) stale; or simply we do not like dense, hard yet chewy chips; conversely, we always appreciate light, crispy, and fresh tortilla chips... to no avail here at VillaLobos. The guac was yummy, yet small for $, and my wife wanted the bacon in it - no longer avail said waiter.  The waiter's suggestion of Fried Chicken over the Scallop Tacos was dead wrong -- the chicken pieces were overly fatty and gristly --poor quality meat. Oh yeah, and my 9 year old epicurean child who loves rice and beans poo-poo'd those here, stating dry and tasteless. Sorry VillaLobos, it's true.     ANNOYING AMBIANCE Like Raymond's around the corner, VillaLobos gets really loud. Yet, i excuse Raymond's, after all, it's Raymonds! (a diner is a diner) Yet, I am sorry to say, conversation was extremely difficult, hence annoying. At least the place looked clean. NOTE: i do not write reviews often, but dinner on Friday September 4, 2015 at 8pm was simply lousy.  I warned my wife that we panned VillaLobos before, but i forgot why. So we tried it again, and again we were left wanting and disappointed.","Andrew M."
"Villalobos",2,"2016-09-17","This place has good taste, and very good presentation. The thing that really annoyed me was that ONE SMALL TACO WAS SIX DOLLARS!!! You need at least 4 of those tacos to be filled up. That ends up being a $24 lunch when you can just go to a Wendy's and get a 4 for 4 meal and be filled up. Again good food, but small expensive portions.","Andre V."

I get the guacamole, which is out of this world, and some vegetable dishes whose names i don't remember, but excellent tastes.

"Villalobos",1,"2014-09-10","I was so excited to find out a new Mexican place had opened up in town.  This is one area where Montclair is lacking. Villalobos is GORGEOUS.  Decorated in a very chic style.  Reminded me of Quince in Jerome AZ. Menu is very appealing with many goodies to choose from. They came out with chips and 2 types of salsas before we ordered. Chips were amazing as were the 2 salsas. This is were amazing ended....... We started with the CEVICHE BLANCO - which was more like ceviche blando.  Red snapper and lime juice is pretty much all I could taste.  The snapper was questionable as to whether or not it needed a few more hours in the juice. then came the Villabos guacamole with sea urchin.  When they first brought  it out I thought it came with pecans on top.   Nope, it was 4 little blops of sea urchin.  A total disconnect from the avocado.   The guacamole was composed of mostly huge chunks of unripe avocado and not much else.   Thanks goodness the chips had some salt on them so it was a saving grace. Then came out our ESQUITES which was good but what do you eat it with?  Chips?  A fork?  Is it a side?  a condiment?   Then the tacos came out .... things go really bad here. For those of you complaining about the size of the tacos - this is the size of a taco in Mexico.  These are authentic in size. We started with the lamb neck special.  Nothing great.  slivers of lamb in a flavorless sauce.  .... eh then had the EL PASTOR - first bite I bit into a hunk of clove and lost my taste buds for a good 10 minutes. then had the BARBACOA - dry and flavorless. we saved the best for last - the LENGUA.... this was the most G_D awful thing I have every put in my mouth..  Well done cubes of tongue with a light pink mayonnaise on top.   One bite and I thought  I was going to puke. All in all the service is excellent.  Presentation of all the dishes was very appealing but spare yourself the calories .... totally not worth the trip.","Dee C."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-09-10","Montclair has continued to be a beacon of culinary ambition... attracting eager restaurateurs to her downtown...  When I heard we were finally garnering a real Mexican joint I was very excited. My taco cravings are met with long trips to Harlem... LES and jersey city... It would be great to be able to dine locally. As a solo diner I was comfortable at the bar and decided it best to graze for my maiden meal at Villalobos... With mole wings on the menu I was helpless and ordered it along with 3 tacos... The wings arrived as a scant portion 4 measly puny wingettes for $13!!!! Keep in mind 4 of these equal 2 actual bird wings. While ANY place else $13 would fetch a dozen wings. I do proclaim that the mole is complex and delicious... Perhaps among the best I've had... Layers of flavors and spiced perfectly.. However, the value is poor.. These are common wings they are using.. Not organic vegetarian free range intellectually and morally superior bird parts.. My hopes for this place began to wane immediately... As I waited eagerly for my tacos.. I was politely asked to move seats so they could accommodate a larger party... My cooperation was awarded with a thimble of mescal.  Arriving shortly after were: Barbacoa taco - Carnitas taco - Pastor Taco Home made tortillas Is this place's mantra... And they are desperately small here... Smallest I've ever seen in fact! I mean just a little more than a bite :(. Yes these are cantina tacos not Taco Bell tacos.. However these are miniature tacos. Cutsy small and appropriate for a passed hours d'vours at a barmitzvah.. I suspect they make the tortillas  in house because ones this small are not commercially produced. The meat was well prepared in each.. Not the slimy overcooked  road kill many places are putting out.. The tacos were not well dressed... Or sauced...  I see tacos in the pictures for this place, and they do not resemble what I was served. I got a tiny dollop of meat on an it's bitsy tortilla... They were a disappointment. While I admit to having poor portion control, I expect more... And so do most consumers outside the 1%... ponying up their post Great Recession/new economy dollar for dishes that are more akin to garnish than an actual order. The restaurant biz is hard... Especially so in Montclair. High rents, no liquor license, tough competition and poor lunch biz make for a difficult equation... I've noticed that no restaurant in Montclair survives very long using the Villalobos approach of overpriced tiny portions in a chic surrounding. I give this place a year.. Depending on how deep the pockets of these hipsters are. My maiden visit here will be my last... As I prey that a real taco joint sets up shoppe soon.","Ari J."

"Villalobos",2,"2016-01-19","Yet again another restaurant in Montclair that is popular simply for the fact that nothing else like it exists in the area. I came here knowing that there was some hype surrounding it and went in with an open mind. The salsa for $6 tasted like canned tomato soup, the tacos were intensely small for $6 a taco, the tortillas fell apart as soon as I picked them up, and the meat was overdone and chewy. I am not a chef but I know that it doesn't take an amazing chef to make a good taco so to hear that this chef has a bunch of clout and can't make a good taco that is marked up for easily 4 times what it costs to make is a huge bummer. I've had better tacos from a taco truck in rural Virginia that cost $1.","Mike C."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-08-30","Great decor, very hospitable, stunning food presentation.  The food, however, did not meet our expectations. The tacos were dry and bland. We had a variety of the pork, fish, chicken and beef tacos and I could not tell the difference amongst them all. The corn appetizer was ok but for $9 you could maybe give me a little more zing.  I am not a food/taco aficionado by any means. But after having various tacos from taco trucks around NYC and at the Chelsea Market, I had my high hopes for Villalobos. They are new and maybe need more constructive criticism.    Bottom line: there is no distinction in the beautifully laid out ingredients of the taco. Bite after bite had me wondering how everything could taste the same.  2 stars for everything but the food.","Armando T."
"Villalobos",4,"2014-08-23","The beautiful decor, presentation and great service pushed it to 4 stars, otherwise, a 3 in my book, but please, read on. I love the decor here, and so of course I went crazy with the photos. This is where I see Montclair going- restaurants that will make you feel like you're in some hip brooklyn spot. In any case, the service was very attentive, and the complimentary chips and salsa were ever flowing. I had two tacos, churos, and an agua fresca.  Loved the agua fresca (prickly pear), even though I expected it to be more of a slushie. I suppose that's a regional thing. The shrimp taco was a bit of a let down. It didn't have enough flavor for me. The beer battered fish taco was very good, and very fresh. The actual taco wrap, which I believe is made in house, was just so-so.  The churos were steamy and fresh, but they weren't crispy enough on the outside for me. They were soft all around, so it made me feel like something was missing. Over all, I'd definitely come back for a fancy date, but if I really want to get my authentic Mexican grub down goin', without the fancy facade, I'll head to el matador.","Chelo K."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-06-17","Villalobos is a standout when it comes to Mexican food. I have been there about 10 times at this point, and am consistently blown away by the quality of the food and care to detail. Each element in the specialty tacos are there for a reason. If you want stock, run-of-the-mill tacos with ground beef and shredded cheese, that's what Taco Bell is for. Villalobos fills a mexican-niche that I love to frequent and $5 per taco is worth the money. The chorizo taco, scallop taco, and fried fish taco are standouts. I always add some of the green salsa to the fish taco for some added acidity. The elote (mexican corn) is a standout. It's a BYOB, and the servers are great about continuing to refill your glass for you. The recent lamb rib appetizer was so tender, so delicious, I was talking about it for days. All in all, you get what you pay for at Villalobos. Money well spent, I'm never disappointed!","Aly R."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-11-19","Came back for a second time and will say this is my last time to back to this restaurant.  I had the tuna tostada which was bland and uninspired.   Then I had 3 different types of tacos  2 of each.  Simply put that the taste profile of the tacos were just mediocre at best.   So I had 6 small tacos and a small tuna tostada.  The bill was $50.  Ridiculous prices for mediocre at best food.  Why this place gets great reviews is a mystery,  In essence, mediocre at best food with high prices.  The taco trucks have better tacos for a cheaper price.","Albert C."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-11-24","All I have to say is $52 for taco lunch.  Overpriced and undersalted food.  The best part was the salsa for the chips.  They get one star for simple decor and nice service and one star for the comped chips (which should be free in the first place).","Wesley T."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-04-03","'Montclair-xican'--says it all. Villalobos is confused. It aspires to be a high end Mexican spot but fails to deliver.  Went here on a Thursday night, and after a short wait were seated. I had high hopes for the Guacamole because it sets the tone-- this is going to be good Mexican or not.. well  it was unbelievably bland- I've made better guacamole at home with a little bit of lime juice and cilantro. Don't bother, eat the chips and salsa they give you for free- it's tastier. What arrived was mashed up avacodos with some onion and they charged us $10+?  If you can't get the Guac right at the very least.. let's move on towards the entrees. I ordered chicken tacos and a shrimp taco- chicken came with a pineapple chutney that was all wrong with the BBQ sauce it was drenched in-not tasty.  Also no dips or sauces for your tacos i.e sour cream/ salsa... Just lonely on the plate and dry.  The shrimp I was looking forward to and it was unfortunately the worst choice of the night- tasted like some Japanese style sauce on Mexican grilled shrimp- yuck! Do not order.  The saving grace way my husbands Brook Trout- it finally fed us for the night along with the avacado bowl aka guacamole.   Really looked forward to checking this place out because the space is energetic and has a great look. What a let down. If your looking for actual Mexican try across the street Casa Piquin- not for the ambiance but for a hell of a good Mexican meal.   This place actually made me invent the word montclair-xican.","Fancy P."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-01-31","I'm really confused by some of the vitriol. This isn't Tex-Mex. This a serious take on traditional Mexican flavors. I've been here maybe a hundred times (no lies) and the first dozen or so visits, they always told us the tacos were the size of the inside circle of the plate. I can get wonderfully full from splitting an app and 2-3 tacos which runs the same tab as anywhere else in town. Must gets: Beet & Arugula Salad, Chilaquiles, Habanero salsa, Arbol salsa, Bacon and Brussel Sprouts Guacamole, and these tacos: Lengua, Carnitas, Camarones, Pescado Pro tip: menu changes often (going to miss that chicken tinga)","Antonio I."

"Villalobos",3,"2015-04-04","3.5 stars We had a nice meal at Villalobos, but it was not without its faults.  For one, my wife and I are from El Paso and Phoenix, so we have had our fair share of Mexican food and done a large amount of traveling in Mexico.  It's not authentic or even super hipster-chic Mexican cuisine, but the atmosphere is clean and modern and the service is attentive.   We were surprised to find that the exec chef did not greet us, even when we noticed who he was. More about the food:  the elote was excellently seasoned and spicy.  My wife got the enchiladas which were made with kale and some dainty pieces of butternut squash.  I got a few tacos:  piscado, brisket (the special), and el pastor (which did not impress).  The chips and salsa were tasty and free.   The prices, overall, seemed a little steep for what you get, but then again, it's Montclair and everything is a little pricey. We might return.","Colby G."

Although i am happy about its success, remember the people that came in the beginning when barely a table was occupied and by local Montclair people. Montclair has become an eating destinatiion, granted few of neighboring towns restaurants are noteworthy. My suggestion is cook hone saturday and avoid Our restaurants.","David S."

The bar was deep enough that I was able to eat comfortably and the staff was not reaching over or bumping into my plate. The ceviche was excellent but this normally inexpensive dish was priced a bit high at $13. The chips and guac were good but again $10 for a single serving is a tad high. The atmosphere was easy and the servers were friendly. The best part for me as a non alcoholic drinker were the choices of non alcoholic mixed drinks! LOVED THIS!  I will be back!","Bella J."

Their Deep Fried fish sandwhich is oily and salty. Their tacos are decent and so are their burritos. Its hard to say I dont crave this place, but I come here for a change a pace for lunch.","Art S."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-05-03","Tortilla and taco shells are homemade. The ingredients are really fresh and the ambiance is very cool. Great for lunch and dinner.  The food is very flavorful and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. You get chips and salsa for the table. Portions are small and the prices are moderate which is expected in Montclair so it fits the area. Tacos are very small. I am a petite girl and three tacos is filling for me. Burritos are a nice size, not too big at all. In general expect small portions.  This is my second time at Villalobos seems like the chef has really enhanced his cooking as the first time I went the food did not have as much taste and or flavor. Very pleased.","Amanda D."
"Villalobos",3,"2016-07-15","Food is very good, but you feel like it's more Brooklyn than Mexico.  I've been here multiple times and the quality was consistent through both trips.  I've gone with  groups and have had the opportunity to try most of the tacos and thought all were done well.  The service is meh.  Received the wrong order more than once.  If you're planning on going during the warm weather months, make sure you try and get a seat by the door or the fan in the back.  Either that or bring an extra shirt to change into.  The air conditioning clearly doesn't work as planned.  I've gotten this feedback from multiple people that have gone.","Brett F."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-03-05","All I can say is woah. Their combination of meat and accents are impeccable. This is a BYOB, so make sure to bring your cervezas. I would definitely recommend trying something out of the ordinary here because their execution is just amazing. Pork belly, beef tongue, and chorizo. That was my order and I loved every bite. The atmosphere is beautiful, and the servers are very nice. A definite must if you're not looking for a loud Spanish cuisine and some delicious tacos.","Maria N."
"Villalobos",2,"2016-03-21","I guess if you put being in such a hip spot over respectful service, this is the place for you. Food is good but as others said, small potions, overpriced. Our waiter made many mistakes. Made a nice dinner into stress fest.","Lily F."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-10-10","I ordered the jumbo shrimp taco -- a pretty deceiving name considering exactly one shrimp came with the taco and it was over after two bites. However I can admit that, that one bite was truly flavorful. I don't know if its truly worth the $7 but hey i think you can decide that for yourself. The food was served quickly, even in the group of 15 people. The staff was polite and helpful and the experience was a good one overall.","Rebekah D."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-10-08","I came here with a group of co-workers after work and we had a great time. Their appetizers are amazing, we had the guacamole, elote, and the ceviche. They were amazing. For the main course i decided to try the tacos, I got 1 carnitas and one pastor de pollo, the pollo taco was the worst!!! The chicken tasted horrible I could barely swallow the first bite. It looked like it was filled with chicken fat and not chicken breast, but other then that the rest of the food was delicious. Just don't get the chicken tacos!!!!","Edlira J."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-12-15","I really like this place. it is is a great area of town and the food is amazing. It is great also because I do not know of many solid taco joints so when ever I am in that taco mood i go here.","Nicholas G."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-02-12","Finally made it out to Villalobos last night and it did not disappoint. Not sure what all the  'meh' reviews are about - our entire meal was delicious from the starters to the dessert. For starters, we had the guac and squash. Both were amazing.  My boyfriend and I split 5 tacos between the 2 of us and it was more than enough... we could barely finish our food. We tried the fish, beef tongue (2, because I wanted my own), pork belly, and short ribs. The fish and the beef tongue were probably my favorite but all were great and had generous amounts of meat for the size of the tortilla. We also got rice and beans as a side (made perfectly), and I tried my roommate's side of kale that they put together just for her (she's vegan, and they were very accomodating with making the food work for her) and it was also great.  Lastly, we split an order of churros b/w the 4 of us, and they were to die for. Didn't even need the chocolate dipping sauce, but HEY why not at that point! The well thought out decor and open layout of the restaurant are just added bonuses - all in all a great dining experience and can't wait to go back.","Emma T."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-02-16","Decided to give Villalobos another try because it's so darn convenient for us on Friday nights - and our friends wanted to try it. So we returned with them AND our kids last week.   I have to say THANK YOU for listening to your customers and the reviews. The service - from the hostess to our waiter - was very good, pleasant. Definitely a notch above from when we were there in December.  And the tacos were excellent - and filling! We tried a couple of the specials and enjoyed those as well.  We'll be back!","Gia M."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-09-17","For starters, this is not necessarily your 'authentic' hole-in-the-wall Mexican place.  Having said that, if you're looking for a comfortable, hip place with interesting food, this is a good option. Everything we ordered tasted great -- but the one item I will probably never forget is the Lengua -- braised beef tongue taco.  In my first few bites, I thought I was eating pure fat -- but then I realized that they had braised and rendered the beef tongue so well that the muscle fibers had broken down, leaving bite-sized cubes of fatty-but-not amazingness.  And then there's the aioli sauce.  Amazing. If nothing else, go just to try the Lengua.","I. C."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-01-02","Villalobos is a great addition to  the Montclair culinary menu! They are probably the most unique of the new breed of taquerias sprouting up in the area and vying for the crown in recreating the street fare that real mexican tacos are and not the over stuffed tex-mex types common in NJ for so long. The staff is nice, the interior is really well put together but the food here is king. Lots of interesting taco choices and the menu seems to be constantly changing The only downside is the relative pricey nature of the tacos at $5 each, meaning its pretty hard to fill up on less than 20 bucks, drink, tax and tip included.  Still, I'll keep coming back for those pork belly tacos. WOW!","Jim S."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-05-29","Creative and unique menu.  You can spend as little or as much money as you'd like since there are so many different options.  Love this place","Adele S."
"Villalobos",1,"2014-10-03","Not to be swayed by the semi-unfavorable reviews, we forged ahead and dropped by for lunch. I'd call it medium-busy, about 1/3 of the tables empty at 1pm.  The problem with leaving a review like this is, we never even got to eat. Despite empty tables, they squeezed us in a 2-top between other diners and we had a baby. So now 3 squeezed in a 2. Our baby doing as babies do kept turning anf messing with out neighbors so we asked for a new table which was accommodated after a few minutes. Mind you, we were there almost 5 minutes already and no waiter. New table, no menus, no water, no chips, still no waiter. We gad yime to feed our vaby a bottle bwfore my fed up wife fetched menus herself. I insisted we wait a but longer but after 15 minutes inside with waiters pirouetting about, but not actually greeting or talking or anything,  we left.","Rich S."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-09-06","We were excited to try this place, even with the fairly average reviews.   Thought that being new they just needed to work out the kinks, but it appears the kinks are still there.   Some similar feelings as to what's been stated by others:  cool atmosphere, very loud. Each of the staff with whom we interacted was nice and friendly.  But we thought the food was either pretty bland or overly salty.  Started with the ceviche and the classic guac.   Each lacked flavor; the guac desperately needed garlic.  I am no chef but in all honesty the guac I make from a food network recipe is *way* better.   Both the carnitas and fish tacos were good, but overly salty.  And the rice and beans were completely bland. Our server asked for feedback and said he'd share it with the chef, though I can't imagine anything changing.   Our expectations were high--this type of food should rock you with flavor--and we were very disappointed.  I wish I could say that we'll give it another shot but, sadly, it's very unlikely.","Matt K."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-01-19","We were super excited when we first ate here - the tacos are pretty good! But. The last 3 times we tried to dine here at a reasonable hour, we were sent away, and there were full tables all around!  Last Sunday we came in at 6:45pm and were told the same thing.  Closed.  The place was packed!  A couple in front of us also looking for a table got mad at the host.  We just wandered away wondering who the heck stops seating on a Sunday night at 6:45?!","Laura P."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-09-11","Sorry to say what I ate was tasty. But comm'on, everything is tiny. Chips tiny, salsa tiny, good, but tiny. Tacos tiny. Charge a fortune for teenie tacos . I want to double my order but it's not a good value.  So why throw money at something that insults my sense of logic. ( drive up the road to chipotle )  I like Spanish food. ( it's the food of my peeps) so when I ask for rice and beans and charge me five dollars, shouldn't it be more than a cup (combined). It doesn't make sense to my Latino side. Sorry. I'm not a dope that buys into the hipster small plates thing. Charge me 15 00 for a plate if food   But I'm not paying 15 bucks for  two tacos the size if silver dollar pancakes and rice and beans in the amount that is normally left on a serving spoon in any kitchen who claims to serve Mexican food.  I won't be back. No mas.","J M C."
"Villalobos",2,"2016-05-05","I actually really like this place!  Probably one of the tastiest tacos I've ever had!  However, I'm frustrated with the service!  I've gotten take out before during 'busy hours' with no problem.  However on this night, she tells me it will take an hour to get my order made!  WHAT?!?!  So I give them at least 25 minutes and then head in!  I realize, they haven't event put my order in once I arrive at the restaurant!  So I'm sitting for another 20 minutes and ask a question and the hostess is not helpful at all!  This is especially frustrating as I see open seats at the bar and open tables. No one is waiting to be seated!  It's clearly not THAT busy!  I feel like the hostess was just being difficult!  It was not until I complained about the time that they offered me a glass of water!  Honestly, if you can't handle take out orders, then don't take them!","Melissa R."
"Villalobos",4,"2014-10-03","I'm still unsure how I feel about here. I came here the other night and nothing really stood out as exceptional, but everything was pretty much solid. My boyfriend and I walked in on a Tuesday evening (no reservations) and were initially seated at the bar, until a table opened up and the servers moved us over.  We were both starving, so we were grateful for the salsa and homemade tortilla chips. We also ordered the Villalobos guac, with sea urchin, which didn't really stand out to me. The sea urchin was sparse and the two flavors didn't complement one another. I would have been find just ordering the class guac. For our entrees, we decided to order ALL of the tacos and sample the 9 between the 2 of us. Well, 8, since they were out of carnitas. Okay, so I'm only going to go through them quickly. Al Pastor de Pollo - Okay, not memorable. Typical chicken taco. Verduras - I am NOT a fan of the mushrooms. My least favorite. Carne Asada - So, this is INCREDIBLY spicy. BUT, I could not stop eating it. My mouth was burning and all I wanted to do was take another bite. The best steak taco I've had. Camarones - My second favorite. The shrimp was seasoned lightly and it was sooo refreshing to eat after the steak. Lengua - So, the beef tongue had an odd texture, but it was also really good. The highlight of this dish is easily the chipotle sauce. I'd put that on everything! Chorizo - The potatos added a nice crunch, but it wasn't memorable. It was a solid taco. Pulpo Asado - I love octopus everything. This was great - light and refreshing. The radish greens were a little big, but it was a great counterpart to the octopus. Obviously, we had to skip dessert. As much as I love chocolate, I couldn't bring myself to eat a chocolate dipped churro. I saw they had a great selection of drinks, but they're BYOB, so naturally, I bought my own. The service was pretty attentive. My water glass was constantly refilled (except, ironically, when my mouth was burning), but like the food, nothing too memorable.  I'll return, but it's not a restaurant worth bragging about. Not just yet.","Andrea N."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-09-11","I was intrigued when a friend recommended this place. Authentic Mexican food in Montclair? Sure, I'll give it a try. Unfortunately, it was as expected: over hyped & overpriced. Appetizers varied in price but averaged about $8-$10. Tacos $4-$5 each, Entrees were $20+. I was a bit puzzled when I saw sopes were $21. At any other restaurant they're an appetizer, though they can be ordered as a meal, and usually run about $2.50 each, maybe $3-4 with meat. Agua fresca was $3 or $4 I think but the size of the glass didn't justify ordering it. You can order a large coffee size Styrofoam cup for $3 and a huge tub for $5 at other establishments. My friend and I ordered esquites as an appetizer. Presentation was great but the way it was served was impractical. Every time I've ever had this snack, it has been in a cup with spoon so when it's served on a flat plate to be split between 2 people it makes it a bit awkward to scoop onto your own plate. Flavor was good, no complaints there but it's definetly not worth $10. I've gotten that same portion (and just as flavorful) from street carts/food trucks for $3- $4.  For dinner I ordered 2 tacos al pastor and 1 lengua (tongue). My friend ordered 2 al pastor tacos as well, I believe, and a side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were different. I've only ever had rice and beans like that at a Cuban restaurant. I'm Mexican and was intrigued that they came out like that. I should mention that my friend who is Puerto Rican was just as intrigued that they had platanos on the menu. A staple in her household, not mine. Anyway, the al pastor tacos were good but again, I've had similar quality tacos from places that are' a hole in the wall' for 1/2 the price. I'd pass on the lengua. I'm not sure if it was the sauce they put on the taco but they tasted absurdly fatty. It left a very strange after taste.  Unfortunately what didn't help was that service was slow. I ran out of water just after I received my dinner and only received a refill once the waitress came to the table after we had finished eating.  I doubt I'd  go back. To me, it didn't live up to expectations. However, it seems to fit in to what some people expect of eateries in Montclair, especially since the place was packed at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night.","Virginia V."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-08-13","I decided to sit at the bar since I was solo. It took approximately 15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge me. Yes the place was busy but not super busy where there's a 45 minute wait. I sat and waited and waited until the owner decided to take my order and the hostess decided to give me chips and salsa. The waitress finally acknowledged me after my order was taken by the owner.  I ordered a chicken taco, which was blasé.  Fish taco- dry and missing some kind of seasoning. And a pork belly taco, which was cold.  I will give this place a try, once they've been established for 6 months. I totally understand there are challenges for a new restaurant and I hope they achieve those challenges.  The decor is very pleasant and it's bYob!","Melissa D."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-02-20","I liked Villalobos and would return to try more tacos.  The chef definitely knows how to prepare octopus - the texture and paring with radish slices in the ceviche were right on! But other favorites, like the guacamole with bacon and brussel sprouts lost their appeal after a few bites.  Many of the tacos and sides were flavored with bacon or carnitas, or oil, and after a while I was craving more acidity and bright, spicy flavors. More clean, less fat. There wasn't any pepper or hot sauce in sight, so I didn't dare ask.  That was our only complaint. Otherwise, we had a nice time mixing our own tequila drinks and soaking in the cool, Santa Fe-meets-warehouse-loft vibe. The Thursday night after work crowd was diverse and noise level just right. You could still have a conversation yet feel the energy in the place.","Jen S."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-08-21","Villalobos is by far one of the best Mexican restaurants I've come across in quite some time. As a server I've developed a pretty sophisticated pallet over the years. Villalobos takes a twist on your traditional Mexican food with it's unique flavors and combinations.    I started off with the Esquites which is the corn off the cob with a cream drizzle, ancho, and cotija cheese . It was awesome and definitely the highlight of the appetizers. I also started off with a couple of tacos. The tortillas are made in house with organic masa which is a huge plus. The Al Pastor was incredible, perfectly seasoned with just the right balance between sweet and savory. I also had the fish taco which was very flavorful and nicely executed.    As my main course I had the braised short ribs with rice and beans. The short ribs were tender and perfectly cooked. They also give you a Mexican pouch with extra tortillas. Who doesn't love extra tortillas ?? I highly recommend Villalobos if you're in the Montclair area. Trust me you won't be disappointed.","Alexis R."
"Villalobos",1,"2014-08-13","Disappointment at best... both service & food were sub par. Service: slow waitstaff, confused about who was our waitress because many people came to our table, they didn't refill our water glasses or chips, waitress brought out wrong food and on top of that it was cold. Food: We ordered the traditional guacamole which was the highlight of our meal. Along with this we also ordered the chicharrones (crispy pork skin) which was incredibly hard to even bite into, it tasted stale and my friend couldn't even take a bite it was that hard... we sent those back to the kitchen and they took it off our bill. The time in between the appetizer and our mains (we ordered taco) was ridiculously long. I don't mind waiting in a restaurant for food, but when it comes out less than lukewarm and tastes like it was cooked the day before I get upset. We had the chicken, pork, fish, and shrimp tacos which were all unmemorable.  Overall the staff looked confused and were not prepared, good idea for a restaurant but the menu was not executed well. I feel bad because it's the opening week, hopefully the staff are able to sort out these issues.","Gabby M."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-04-13","Had a delicious lunch here.  Menu only had a couple of vegetarian and vegan items listed, but the owner came over and went through item by item and offered that they could veganize most of their menu. I will definitely come back.","J T."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-08-17","Oh geez. Where to start. Something nice first: the owners put a lot of thought in to the looks of this place and it has a very cool vibe.  But the food is just really bad. We had several appetizers. Ceviche was good, but the tuna and watermelon had no taste at all and the gazpacho actually tasted like dirt. Like a handful of soil. The tacos were no better. I had a chicken taco which was very dry. I also had a fish taco and it had raw jalapeños in it. Which is fine, but they weren't listed in the description. So it was a really surprising bite. The acoustics are also really terrible. Couldn't hear my friend right next to me.  We wanted to like this place but probably won't be back.","Rebecca K."

"Villalobos",1,"2015-08-05","Over priced and under sized. For one tiny taco you dish out more then at normal taco places for three. Guacamole was over topped with cilantro, I like cilantro but not when it's the whole meal. The chips were alright tho","Gabriela J."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-08-28","Went last night with my wife.  Waited about 20 minutes at the bar for  table.  No biggie.  Salsa was good with the home-made chips. We started with traditional guac and it was great.  So fresh with a bit of extra lime than I am used to.  Really enjoyed it. I had the carnitas, barbacoa and pescado tacos for dinner.  I liked them.  Could have used a bit more punch but they were very good.  $5 for rice and beans to have a side was a bit much. My wife had the short ribs.  She liked them and I tried them as well.  For one, they were so spicy she could barely eat them, and we are  spice family, me more than her.  But the plate was very one note in terms of texture.  Needed some crunch, especially if you serve them with tortillas.  There was no crunch.  Could have used some type of slaw. Unfortunately our service was terrible.  Our waitress took forever to come to our table and the only time we saw her was when she took our order and to make sure our guac got there.  Nothing else.  We couldn't even find her when we wanted the check.  Someone else brought it.  Its the first time I have only left 15% in 10 years.  We planned on desert but got so antsy.  So the waitress lost a little money for the restaurant. Our bus boy was great, even the hostess said he gets complimented.  He should have been our server. The noise level is off the charts though.  My bus boy asked if we were done with our guac, which was still 1/3 full, and we said we were still working on it, and he took it away.  Not his fault.  Its so loud. We will go back again once they have had some time to get the kinks out to give it one more try.","Joe P."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-05-21","Wonderful food, service and environment.  The Elote is amazing.  The Guac with bacon is a stand out and the carnitas are like nothing I've ever had.  I see some people complaining about the price, I however disagree.  While it's not cheap, I think it's priced very fairly.","Jarrett s."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-08-13","Villalobos is an excellent Mexican restaurant in the heart of downtown Montclair. Yesterday I ordered the fish & verduras tacos and a margarita (virgin but they are BYOB). The verduras taco was quite tasty. The corn was fresh & crisp and had the right amount of smoke. The fish taco was battered and topped with cole slaw. Their house-made tortillas taste even better than the ones at a typical Mexican food cart. Both accompanying salsa's (salsa verde and regular salsa) were fresh, well seasoned and authentic. I actually ended up ordering the same thing for lunch today along with an order of guacamole that was legit.  It's really dangerous working directly next door to them so I'll have to schedule my visits. Adam, the owner, is a great dude. Go, you won't be disappointed!","Tasha H."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-08-26","I noticed Villalobos when I was walking to shop on Church Street and was so excited to come back because it looked so cute. I love the rustic decor, it's a nice change from the typical spots in the area.  My husband and I shared the sea urchin guacamole to start- it was fresh and something I haven't had before. We really enjoyed our main course tacos. The menu is mix and match which I love because I can never decide on just one! We both had the short rib taco, the 'tinga' chicken taco, then my husband had the pork belly and I had the vegetable  taco. They were all the delicious. The vegetable taco was actually my favorite- super flavorful with just the right amount of spice. My husband loved the pork belly, and we both really enjoyed the rest.  We would definitely recommend Villalobos for a fun date night, or for a group dinner. We'll be going back with friends!","Ashley B."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-06-20","Went here for Saturday lunch and had a really great experience. First off, the restaurant is beautiful inside....rustic and simple with a nice, big bar. To start, we had the guacamole and elote....both were really delicious. The corn was such a great, big portion and I could've made a meal out of just that, it was so good.  Then we had the fish and carnitas tacos with a side of papas bravas....all were delicious and the perfect size. Sometimes tacos are overdone with too much 'stuff' in them....these were tasty and simple. The papas were super spicy and yummy, and they didn't have a sauce smeared on them which can sometimes ruin the dish. Overall, we loved it and would definitely go back again.","Corey S."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-06-20","Wonderful food, great vibe! Terrific service.  We enjoyed the veggie tacos, the mushrooms were decedent.  The fish taco fantastic, fresh succulent.  The entire menus is gluten free, except for the deserts.  Thank you!","Stacy B."

"Villalobos",3,"2014-10-22","My husband and have been wanting to try Villalobos and so we went in for lunch this week.  It was pleasant enough of an experience that we may come back to try dinner.  When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately.  The space is beautifully designed with a marriage of rustic charm and sleek modernisim with touches of traditional Mexican elements. The overall result is a very cool vibe. I love the open kitchen and bar area. Now for the food, I ordered the steak torta and the chorizo and papas taco.  The taco was spicy and full of flavor, the papas were interpreted as chips rather than the traditional diced preparation.  It was very good and much better than my torta.  The torta while solid was not a standout.  While all the elements of a traditional torta were there, the very distinct flavors just weren't there.  Overall I was left feeling like I could have ordered a sandwhich from a deli.  My husband had the chicken, shrimp and fish tacos.  He thought they were also solid but nothing exceptional.  Of the three the chicken and shrimp were the best.  His major complaint was that they fall apart too easily and perhaps the tortillas should be doubled or give more tacos with less of a filling, it's hard to enjoy them as they fall apart in your hand. He also had the plaintains, they were hot and crispy as tostones should be.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly.","Carmen W."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-01-22","One of my favorites. Never a bad meal and great service. The tacos are incredible. It is a great spot for a business lunch, group dinner, or date night. Parking lot near by as well which makes getting it super easy as well.","Billy M."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-11-25","Very cool in side decor.  The service seemed promising at first the waitress came right over and we were brought some chips and a very small portion of 2 salsas. Then we never saw her again.  We asked for extra salsa and more water a few times and each time we were flagging down a bus boy.  The pazole was good but the bowl it was served in was not meant for a soup but more of an app.  The sopes were very good.  My husband got the steak torte which was very dry.  I had the steak, pork, and chorizo tacos.  All very good but hands down doesn bet the Taqueria Autentica in Bloomfield on taste plus it was double the price.","Marisa A."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-07-22","This place was ok. I met a friend here for dinner a couple days ago.  We shared the chips and guacamole, the hijote, and we each got a taco.  It was just the right amount of food and we were able to get a little taste of a couple of items.  The chips and guacamole were okay.  There was nothing that special about it.  I hated the hijote. They had some seasoning on it that I was just not a fan of.  The tacos were okay.  I ordered one of the tacos without onions and it came with onions on it...not a big deal for me, but not good for people who are particularity picky.  My taco came with a lot of meat on it, but it was very messy to eat.   I thought the menu was pretty small.  There were a lot of exotic items on it, but not many basic ones which I thought was odd. The service was great!  Our server was constantly checking up on us and refilling our waters.   It was pretty crowded for a weeknight.   Overall it was okay.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but would manage if a friend really wanted to go.","Sandy S."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-09-16","I would have given this place more stars if the service was better. I came here tonight with my friend and the atmosphere was beautiful and the energy was good, so I was expecting better. We were seated quickly, but our waitress  (Kate I believe) didn't come for awhile (which was fine considering my friend and I were talking). The food was good and I loved the guacamole, but I feel the food was a bit overpriced for the portion size. We were served our appetizers, but once we were about to be served dinner, we realized our drinks never came. We told our waitress and she finally brought them ... the drink situation was not a big deal to us, but it got worse.  This is when we got annoyed ... After we finished our dinner, the bus boy cleared our plates. Not once while we were eating dinner did we see our waitress. She never came to ask us how our food was, if we needed anything else, etc. We realized she was too busy chitchatting with her work friends than to do her job and be a decent waitress. After sitting for awhile after having our plates cleared (maybe a good 20-25 mins), I finally asked another waiter to get our waitress (who was still chitchatting). She came over with the check and never even asked if we wanted dessert.  I'm not about posting negative reviews, but this place is new and it needs to work on the cons if it plans on getting better. Overall, good food but the service seriously lacked .... at least for us.","Sydney H."

"Villalobos",5,"2016-01-10","One of our favorites in Montclair. Fresh and inventive tacos, great and friendly service, unique specials, reasonably priced and always a seat at the bar where we usually hang out devouring guacamole and tacos. We always feel like Villalobos flies under the radar, but hope it will be around for a long time to come.","Nolan H."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-04-10","We went today for a late lunch and we definetly enjoyed it. We've been meaning to come for some time now and today was finally the day. The menu is small and quaint , which I prefer a lot BC you know they focus on those items and make them to perfection . we Had the guacamole for an app, it was a good size and it was yummy, we def filled up on that and the chips. For our main course we had tacos. We had a shrimp taco, pork belly, brisket, sauasge, and meat omelete, and all were just as good with a different flavor to each. I love that they come as an individual and you can choose what and how many you prefer. We would def come again and def is great for a lunch choice.","Anna P."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-07-25","Meh. If you like going to over crowded and noisy restaurants with bland food, mediocre service, and a too-cool-for-Brooklyn vibe this is the place for you.  On the plus side the ingredients are fresh.  On the negative side, well the list is long.  But because the room has a nice design aesthetic (and prices to match), people ignore the many obvious failings including the service with attitude.  With so many other good options in the Montclair area, why waste your time and money here?","George A."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-04-03","Super fresh. Creative specials. Love the tacos. Just like mom makes. Open floor plan but not too noisy. Love the open kitchen so I can watch them cook. Good service. Reasonable prices which are hard to find in mc.","Elizabeth M."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-05-02","Went there for an early dinner with my mom today. Everything was wonderful. We had the fresh guacamole, scallop tacos and chicken taco. Very nice service, really good food and reasonable prices.","June Z."
"Villalobos",3,"2015-05-30","It's okay. I like the shrimp taco. I think the pork taco is a bit too slaty for my taste. The staff was really nice.","Edna E."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-02-21","My fiancé and I (well, more so my fiancé) found this spot after hunting down a chef from a former restaurant in Montclair. I have to give credit where it is due. The food here is amazing. We started off with the chips and homemade sauces (thumbs up) and we each tried 3 different tacos (pork, fish, chicken) and he ordered an extra chorizo. All of them were delicious!! The only compliant we had was that the chorizo was a bit too salty but good nonetheless. In addition we ordered a side of broccoli with (once again) a homemade dipping sauce. Will definitely be returning. :)","Jess K."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-07-13","The tacos are great; the guac is fantastic!  The rice and beans could be better, but everything else is excellent, including the service!","Paula P."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-04-11","Just stopped in on Saturday for lunch with my wife.  Outstanding!  Had fish taco, calamari taco and shrimp taco....each was delicious with unique interesting flavors.  We also had a chicken tamal...wow! Excellent friendly service...very nice atmosphere.... We'll be back soon!","Robert W."
"Villalobos",5,"2016-01-03","My experience has been consistently great. From the service to the food. I am never disappointed. My wife and I love it here. And would highly recommend it.","Joe D."
"Villalobos",4,"2014-12-24","Villalobos is a great spot for some modern and fresh takes on Mexican cuisine. They have a list of about a dozen appetizers, a few plates and a list of about eight tacos. The chips with red and green salsas on the table are great. It's a BYOB like a lot of places in Montclair. It looked like they had some slush machines running, not sure if that is something they will mix for you with booze, or if it is a drink on its own.  We split appetizers of guacamole (this ain't chipotle but guac is still extra!!!), beef crudo and a tostada topped with a tuna tartare. The guacamole was fresh, chunky and great with the house made chips. The beef crudo was dressed with a peppery blend of spices, mixed with chopped egg, small potato chips and had a nice balance of acid to cut through the beef and egg. The tuna tostada was topped with fresh tuna chopped with winter melon and black sesame seeds on top of a crisp tortilla. The tuna was better than I've had at most sushi restaurants. The winter melon and black sesame flavored the dish without being overpowering, really letting the tuna shine. We loved the tacos!! But at $5 each they are kinda expensive (but the quality was A-1). Expect to order 3-4 per person. The tortillas were hot and fresh. All the tacos we tried (and loved) were the calamari which was lightly breaded and fried, carnitas made with pork belly braised in coca cola, lengua (beef tongue) which was fatty and braised until tender, spicy chorizo with potato, fried crispy fish, short rib and flavorful chicken al pastor. Will have to come back and try some more menu items.","Spike T."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-03-19","They have updated their menu and the experience has much improved! It's now one of my favs - small portions, guacamole still amazing, and their food is def on the creative, LA style fresh Mexican.","Jill W."
"Villalobos",1,"2016-04-16","To start I never write reviews and especially bad ones, but I was really appalled by this restaurant.  My husband and I tried this place when it first opened and it was awful. The guacamole only tasted of lime and was completely sour and our entrees were bland and flavorless. With that being said we decided to give it a second try in April 2016, we came on a Friday at 6:30 evening with our infant son in a stroller.  The restaurant was not crowded at all and the host at the front door told us there was no availability and that we could only sit at the bar or outside (on there one table they had that was not set up on a cool April evening), obviously with a stroller and infant neither of these were an option. When asked about the open tables, which was about half the restaurant, he was rude and said they were all reserved.  He did not even look around or see if anyone was finishing up or check their reservation list, which made it clear he just did not want us there with our child.  As a previous reviewer has stated they do not like families with children and are extremely rude about it. Montclair is a family town and this establishment should expect that people will bring their children, especially at 6:30 pm. My husband and I moved from Brooklyn to be in a family friendly town, but to be honest much trendier and better restaurants in Brooklyn were more accommodating to children and strollers than this restaurant was. As a new mom and newer resident to the area, I am completely disappointed in this restaurant and the character of the employees on their staff.","Kelley W."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-12-27","We had an absolutely fabulous meal tonight. For us, the tacos and the appetizer menus were perfect for small plate sharing. All specials tonight (jicama winter melon salad, scallop taco and pineapple with creme anglais) were absolute winners. The services was friendly, professional and engaging. We'll absolutely be back.","Jennifer Z."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-09-16","Even with the service being so-so, the food more than made up for it.  As an appetizer, we had the Tostada de Atun, nothing short of incredible. The combination of watermelon and tuna is amazing. Dinner or snack, the tacos are excellent. Pork belly, tongue, shrimp...all great. For dessert, a house-made churro dipped in chocolate. Yum.   We will have to go back for entrees, but nothing disappoints. Sit at the bar if you can, to watch a great presentation.","Ben G."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-03-06","Fun and loud, with delicious tacos. Get a bunch to share. The guacamole had chorizo in it and was magical. Also they had a scallop taco special that was delicious. Great place for after a movie.","Tom C."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-10-18","Five star service, but one star food.  The tortilla chips were thick and flavorless.  My salad contained a hair which did not belong to me.  The server assured me the kitchen staff wore hairnets, but I had lost my appetite at that point.","Kelly H."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-05-15","Excellent tacos! Seasonal menu that is always staying fresh. Also I recommend you try the slushies. Cool classy flavor that mix well with libations.","Sophie S."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-05-08","The service was good and I liked the atmosphere. I had chicken and beef tacos for which I didn't care much. The meat did not taste fresh","Ebrahim A."
"Villalobos",2,"2015-11-07","This place is usually a 5 star establishment. Tonight they sat my friends and I in front of the front door which was wide open on a brisk November night. When we asked them to close it they said no, the rest of the place would get hot. When we asked to be moved, they told us everything was reserved in the back, my friends and I felt like second class citizens. All told to us by a manager. At this point you would assume a complementary appetizer for this terrible situation, none of which was offer. For such a great restaurant, dining in a winter coat is simply poor management and customer service.","Mandy C."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-10-29","Stone faced hostess and waitress to start. Was tempted to order guacamole but not for $10 and $13. $3.00 to reorder chips and salsa... WHAT???  This should be standard in a Mexican restaurant!!! Ordered 10 tacos...to share.  Seems that the ingredients were slopped into a tortilla that was semi warm/not cold.  $5 should include at least 1 ounce of meat/fish etc. but fell short, as did the spices. Yuck!!!  This will not last long. Did not even bother to order chicken legs for $28.00.","Mary R."
"Villalobos",1,"2015-11-03","Rated best newcomer in Montclair Magazine. Thought we would try it. Everything was dry. One star for ok guacamole.","Margie P."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-08-22","Great new Montclair restaurant...  The chips and salsas that they bring when you sit down are great - really fresh.  The villalobos (guac with tomatillos and uni) is very good and unique, especially with replenished warm tortilla chips.  But the tacos were really what made the meal for us.  The lengua (beef tongue) taco was so awesome that my husband ordered a second.  The al pastor was by far my favorite - had a distinct taste of pineapple and really flavorful heat.  Churros for dessert were delicious too.  Overall a great meal!  Service could use a bit of work, but the waitress was very sweet and I'm sure they're just still working a few things out.  Also, the atmosphere was great, which is one of the biggest shortfalls we have found at other restaurants in town.  We will definitely be back and are looking forward to bringing tequila next time to mix margaritas...","Kim K."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-10-17","I passed by this place a few weeks ago and finally decided to give it a try. The ambiance is very nice. They have a very limited menu with only a few drinks (It's BYOB but the Watermelon Mint drink is super refreshing!). As for the food, that too is limited and cannot be customized in any way. As a vegetarian, this was a bit of a problem. All of the ingredients seem really fresh and healthy. The fillings aren't your normal vegetables. They had a special when I went that was blue corn tortilla quesadillas with a corn fungus filling - not something I would recommend. I hope that they work on being less trendy with the food and better the taste of the actual dishes. The portions are REALLY small and you have to pay extra for salsa and guac - ridiculous right? I also had the verduras tacos and it was not good.  The best part about this place and the only thing that will probably keep me going back forever are the CHURROS! They are absolutely, hands down, the best churros i've ever had in my entire lifetime. Perfectly crisp, loaded with cinnamon and sugar. This place should be called the Churro Factory and ONLY specialize in custom churros - that could be a fad, right?","N S."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-09-15","Really trying to love this place as we anxiously awaited its opening.  Been twice though and they've got some work to do.  It's like Teach for America started a Mexican restaurant.   Food:  The 2 complimentary salsas are excellent.  The guac is good, but, I agree with whoever below said about the sea urchin guac - it just doesn't make sense. By now I think we've been through all of the tacos (including a few good specials like the lamb neck and carne asada). I say they are excellent, but the wife thinks they're just good.  I think she's being harsh because she can't get past the service, which I need to turn to because it is still pretty awful 6 weeks after opening. Service: A few of the young hipster waiters make up for their inexperience with a great attitude. There are a few really nice guys & girls taking orders.  But they really need to learn how to wait.  One girl came to our table and seriously said: 'I have some specials if anyone wants to hear about them.'  Then she read the descriptions verbatim (including the part describing the flavors - that was probably written for her so she can act like she actually tasted them).  It was funny.   Also, the hostess is pretty bad.   We watched as a couple walked out in disgust after waiting 20 minutes for a table - only to see another couple who walked in after them get seated before them.  Hostess was not apologetic and acted like they were the bad guys for leaving.  I really think they would benefit by hiring at least one or two older experienced waiters.  Kids with beards and hasidic hats are cool, but you also need some people who can get the job done and perhaps teach the cubs how to do it.   We'll be back - I would expect this place gets better with time.","Jozef B."
"Villalobos",1,"2015-09-26","Went here with a group and everyone seemed to be disappointed with the menu and their meal. Id rather go to a tingas","Jennifer C."
"Villalobos",2,"2014-09-03","We planned a birthday celebration here about a week ago and were a group of 16. A couple of people in the group had tried this place and were raving about it,  however, as a group, the experience was far from satisfactory. The restaurant is fairly new and has a small menu. They are BYO and in order for the evening to go smoothly, they suggested we put in our appetizer order earlier in the day, which we did. Sounds efficient until two of our friends did not receive their appetizer (we had already placed our dinner orders by then) even after we repeatedly reminded our servers. In the end they did bring out one order of Chicken Wings and when we reminded them about one outstanding Ceviche order, the waitress became extremely defensive and kept saying she wasn't the one who took the order and that it was all up to the person who answered the phone when we called it in. This is a bad sign--if you mess up, have the decency to own up and do whatever you can to make up for it. It's not that hard.  For dinner, I ordered the veggie taco (very limited veggie options, BTW) and I am glad I asked for 2 because the portion was tiny. And not very good at all. We did not want to make a fuss because we were treating a friend for her birthday, but we had to repeatedly ask for our orders and for water and sauces for the table. It was highly disappointing to have substandard service when there are so many restaurants in Montclair to choose from. I don't think the staff at Villalobos is equipped to handle groups and maybe they will get better with time. I do know that some people in our group were very unhappy and including myself, will not be going back to the restaurant.","Ritu M."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-11-08","Went for dinner there last night with my husband and a friends, and we were all surprised at how delicious everything was. Right from the start, the salsas they serve you with the chips are unlike anything we'd ever tasted. They were ridiculously good. Only complaint is that only give you able two tablespoons worth. The tacos were equally as good. I had the chicken, carne asada, scallops and beef tongue. All worth it! My husband and friend also had four tacos each. We were all very satisfied and will definitely be going back!  p.s. The decor and ambience alone are worth it.","Natalie M."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-10-12","Loved it!! Awesome guac, amazing tacos - had the verduras, pescado & camarones- great salsa. This is not a burrito restaurant (ie. tex mex), it's legit. I'm jealous that it's not in my neighborhood, but it's worth the trip. Will be back.","Sandi S."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-10-12","Be warned. If you pay in cash, they round up. My bill was for $13.91, I gave them a $20, and I got $6 in change. What the what?! When I asked I was told point blank that they round up on cash payments, but they'd give me my change if I really wanted it. It was 9 cents, I didn't make a big deal about it, but I did lower the amount of my tip just a bit.  I told my server on the way out that this was not a good policy, that it was punitive to people who pay cash, and that while I would likely be back I would only pay by credit card (and let them be out the 3% to the bank in fees).  Really uncool.   I was so excited that a mexican restaurant opened in Montclair, especially one block from my apartment.  I dropped in for a quick lunch yesterday and sat at the bar. It was surprising that the service was slow given that the restaurant wasn't especially full. I had two tacos which I thought were really very good (yes, small, but exactly what I wanted), the chips were fantastic, and the slushy I had was delicious, however... this cash payment situation left a really bad taste in my mouth.  I very much hope the management changes this immediately.","Julie S."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-02-09","had really inventive, delicious Mexican-inspired meals both times I've eaten there.  Enjoyed sitting at at the counter where we received attentive and gracious service. Especially good were the tongue and the scallop tacos, the sublime churros...","Robert C."
"Villalobos",4,"2014-11-02","My fiance and I recently spent a week in San Diego, eating a ton of great tacos so we were craving them and decided to go here.  We started with ceviche and then we each got a variety of tacos.  They were all fantastic!  The carnitas (which is actually pork belly) was so good and the special that night was a scallop taco which was fabulous!! They unfortunately don't take reservations for groups under 8 so there can be a long wait, but it's BYOB so bring a bottle of something, open it up and have a drink at the bar!  Fun addition to the neighborhood!","Alison L."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-06-02","Yummy post movie meal. I've been wanting to check this place out since they opened. Great staff. Warm and welcoming. We ordered the tuna tostadas to start. Crisp and delicious. Then onto tacos: Tongue, scallop, pork belly and rock shrimp. All were good heat, acid and flavors. The tongue and scallop were hands down the favorites. We ordered aqua frescas those were a bit lackluster. The broccoli side had too much oil, no salt, too much cayenne and were just OK. Hamburguesa is worth an hour drive. Oh my Jesus. Killer. Maybe one of the greatest I have ever eaten. Crunch, sauce, bun, saltiness and price tag was 10. What? This is a cool spot with really, really good service and staff. At times they can over service taking plates before you are finished. Too anxious but mean well.  Decor: The place is adorable. Tasteful and has so much ambiance. We'll be back to try more specials like Soft Shell crab and whatever else the chef is cooking. Montclair has but a few great spots worth the effort of finding a place to park. Villalobos is definitely a spot worth coming to and a business to support so GO GO GO. Modern Mexican right here in Jersey. Yay!","gail s."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-02-03","My experience at Villalobos is always an excellent one. Such a great spot with lovely decor and a unique yet still traditional twist on Mexican cuisine. The wait staff are always on point and able to give great recommendations and the food is always top notch. Every detail from the salsa down to the music that they play is well thought out and adds to the restaurants charm. I regularly tell friends about this spot and I've never had one person not give a summary that in more or less words could sound identical to the one you're reading now. Definitely one of NJ's hidden gems.","Sean S."

"Villalobos",5,"2015-03-14","Amazing. Or as my friend said: 'Every bite is a surprise.' A delicious surprise. Every bite was fantastic. I wish I was a food writer to better express myself.  We ordered the guacamole (best I've ever had), a variety of tacos (I eat only plants and they have lots of plant-based options, by the way), this incredible onion dish.  And they make the 'bread' that serves as the taco shell, unbelievable--soft, melt in your mouth, but not at all oily or greasy.  We sat at the counter and just loved the ambiance.","Carole A."
"Villalobos",4,"2015-03-08","Delicious - can't wait to go back. ( went for lunch) Chips are fresh & hot - dipping sauces yummy . Shrimp appetizer - great 2 tacos per person - the beer batter fish was great, and the grilled chicken was moist and tasty.      Would definitely go back.  Only call out - server was nice enough, just a bit tentative explaining portion size and the slushy machine which wasn't ready yet (not cold enuf for the lunch crowd...?) etc.  Take command!  it is your restaurant, don't apologize.  2 yums up.","J S."
"Villalobos",4,"2014-10-26","Came here on a Thursday night. The restaurant was packed and there was a wait so we sat at the bar. Great ambiance--the place has an overall vibrant atmosphere and I really loved the decor.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. We tried the ceviche, the corn 'off' the cob, and several tacos--al pastor de pollo, lengua, carnitas, and pescado. I wasn't a big fan of the Oaxacan rice and beans but everything else was very good. All of the tacos were tasty...small to perfectly fit in one hand but melt in your mouth delicious. We had the churros for dessert and they were a perfect end to a good meal. I would definitely return.","Christine G."
"Villalobos",3,"2014-12-30","I tried this place over the weekend and was 'unmoved.'  The place has a really nice decor and the service is adequate but the food that we tried was bland albeit all we had were tacos.  We had the tongue, fish, calamari and pastor chicken tacos.  All arrived at room temperature not hot, all seemed fresh but must have been cooked before we ordered, and all were bland even the pastor chik! They lacked zing in the  form of a sauce or a pickled something to pick them up. The portions were adequate but they are small tacos so five bucks a pop is steep even by Montclair standards.","Darla C."
"Villalobos",1,"2015-06-13","Very disappointing. Limited menu. Pricey for somewhat bland tacos made with frozen/canned vegetables and processed tomato paste. For those prices I'd like FRESH ingredients please. The atmosphere is nice but I came to eat....and left hungry. The kicker...the server asked if we wanted dessert (which I did because I was starving).  She then added....'well, we only have churros.'  This was after we ordered the mexican burger special only to be told later that they had no burger buns.  What a joke. There are much better restaurants in Montclair where I plan to spend my money.","Lynn M."
"Villalobos",5,"2015-01-27","Villalobos is a great addition to Montclair! My husband and I went with some friends on a recommendation and we were not disappointed. The atmosphere is eclectic and friendly. The owner and chef have no issues checking in on guests and making your experience everything it can be. The service was FANTASTIC! If you get Mike as your waitor (lucky you!) definitely order based on his recommendations! The menu is small but delicious an the specialities that Villobos provides are extremely unique. Where else can you order a beef tongue or scallop taco??  The restaurant is BYOB so prepare to have a few bottles of wine if you're with friends, something sweeter like a Riesling if you're like me and aren't a huge fan of spicy food =) My husband ordered the carne asada and it was cooked perfectly. We had the homemade bacon guacamole and fondue dishes for appetizers which were amazing. I recommend ordering something that comes with tortillas as they are made fresh on premises daily.The restaurant itself can get a little loud between the music and groups of people but it wasn't anything that would deter me from going back. It actualy made the place more fun! With all that said we cannot wait to go back and try their spring/summer menu.","Kimberly K."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-10-20","Delicious. The waiters and waitresses are incredibly nice and helpful. The place is just formal enough for a nice dinner but no dress code required.

"Villalobos",3,"2014-09-07","Okay- I'd still come back but I'd only get the fish tacos and guacamole . I was excited for the agua fresca but it was so watered down it was tasteless. The chips are good but the service is uneven. Just get the tacos.  It's such a nice looking place. I'm hoping they take some feedback because we'd like to make it a regular go to. I'll go one more time and make assessment .","Rachel G."
"Villalobos",5,"2014-10-11","YUM. If you do nothing else, get the carnitas taco. Like three of them. Don't forget the tequila for 'slushies' and for the love of god, leave room for the churros!
