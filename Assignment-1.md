### Assignment 1

#### Introduction

This assignment is based on the homework of the lecture **Data science with R**. The file `tata.csv` contains daily OCHL (Open/Close/High/Low) data for Tata Steel, from the National Stock Exchange in Mumbai, extracted from Yahoo Finance India. The dates go from 2003-01-01 to 2015-12-31.

#### Tasks

1. Produce a statistical summary for the adjusted close prices.

2. Calculate the daily returns and the logarithmic returns for the adjusted close prices and compare them.

3. Plot a histogram of the returns. Can a normal distribution be used as a model here?

4. Produce a line plot for the returns, with the syntax `plot(returns, type="l")`.  

#### Submission

Submit the code used to develop your predictive model, with comments and a few conclusion lines at the end.

#### Deadline

January 30 (Tuesday), 24:00.
