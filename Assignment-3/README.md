### Assignment 3

#### Introduction

This assignment is based on the example of the lecture **Logistic regression**. Assume that the Omicron management plans to offer a 20% discount to the customers that the model classifies as potential churners, and that this offer is going to have a 100% success, so the company will retain all the churners.

#### Tasks

1. Evaluate the benefit produced by this retention policy with the two models already developed.

2. Define an `R` function that gives the benefit in terms of the cutoff and find an optimal cutoff for this retention policy.

#### Submission

Submit the code used, with comments.

#### Deadline

October 10 (Tuesday), 24:00.
